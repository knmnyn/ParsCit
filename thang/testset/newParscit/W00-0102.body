Abstract 
We propose a method for dealing with 
semantic complexities occurring in 
information retrieval systems on the basis of 
linguistic observations. Our method follows 
from an analysis indicating that long runs of 
content words appear in a stopped document 
cluster, and our observation that these long 
runs predominately originate from the 
prepositional phrase and subject 
complement positions and as such, may be 
useful predictors of semantic coherence. 
From this linguistic basis, we test three 
statistical hypotheses over a small collection 
of documents from different genre. By 
coordinating thesaurus semantic categories 
(SEMCATs) of the long run words to the 
semantic categories of paragraphs, we 
conclude that for paragraphs containing both 
long runs and short runs, the SEMCAT 
weight of long runs of content words is a 
strong predictor of the semantic coherence 
of the paragraph. 
Introduction 
One of the fundamental deficiencies of current 
information retrieval methods is that the words 
searchers use to construct terms often are not the 
same as those by which the searched information 
has been indexed. There are two components to 
this problem, synonymy and polysemy 
(Deerwester et. al., 1990). By definition of 
polysemy, a document containing the search 
terms or indexed with the search terms is not 
necessarily relevant. Polysemy contributes 
heavily to poor precision. Attempts to deal with 
the synonymy problem have relied on 
intellectual or automatic term expansion, or the 
construction of a thesaurus. 
Also the ambiguity of natural language causes 
semantic complexities that result in poor 
precision. Since queries are mostly formulated 
as words or phrases in a language, and the 
expressions of a language are ambiguous in 
many cases, the system must have ways to 
disambiguate the query. 
In order to resolve semantic complexities in 
information retrieval systems, we designed a 
method to incorporate semantic information into 
current IR systems. Our method (1) adopts 
widely used Semantic Information or 
Categories, (2) calculates Semantic Weight 
based on probability, and (3) (for the purpose of 
verifying the method) performs partial text 
retrieval based upon Semantic Weight or 
Coherence to overcome cognitive overload of 
the human agent. We make two basic 
assumptions: 1. Matching search terms to 
semantic categories should improve retrieval 
precision. 2. Long runs of content words have a 
linguistic basis for Semantic Weight and can 
also be verified statistically. 
1 A Brief Overview of Previous Approaches 
There have been several attempts to deal with 
complexity using semantic information. These 
methods are hampered by the lack of 
dictionaries containing proper semantic 
categories for classifying text. Semantic 
methods designed by Boyd et. al. (1994) and 
Wendlandt et. al. (1991) demonstrate only 
simple examples and are restricted to small 
numbers of words. In order to overcome this 
6 
deficiency, we propose to incorporate the 
structural information of the thesaurus, semantic 
categories (SEMCATs). However, we must also 
incorporate semantic categories into current IR 
systems in a compatible manner. The problem 
we deal with is partial text retrieval when all the 
terms of the traditional vector equations are not 
known. This is the case when retrieval is 
associated with a near real time filter, or when 
the size or number of documents in a corpus is 
unknown. In such cases we can retrieve only 
partial text, a paragraph or page. But since there 
is no document wide or corpus wide statistics, it 
is difficult to judge whether or not the text 
fragment is relevant. The method we employ in 
this paper identifies semantic "hot spots" in 
partial text. These "hot spots" are loci of 
semantic coherence in a paragraph of text. Such 
paragraphs are likely to convey the central ideas 
of the document. 
We also deal with the computational aspects 
of partial text retrieval. We use a simple 
stop/stem method to expose long runs of context 
words that are evaluated relative to the search 
terms. Our goal is not to retrieve a highly 
relevant sentence, but rather to retrieve a portion 
of text that is semantically coherent with respect 
to the search terms. This locale can be returned 
to the searcher for evaluation and if it is 
relevant, the search terms can be refined. This 
approach is compatible with Latent Semantic 
Indexing (LSI) for partial text retrieval when the 
terms of the vector space are not known. LSI is 
based on a vector space information retrieval 
method that has demonstrated improved 
performance over the traditional vector space 
techniques. So when incorporating semantic 
information, it is necessary to adopt existing 
mathematical methods including probabilistic 
methods and statistical methods. 
2 Theoretical Background 
2.1 Long Runs 
Partial Information Retrieval has to with 
detection of main ideas. Main ideas are topic 
sentences that have central meaning to the text. 
Our method of detecting main idea paragraphs 
extends from Jang (1997) who observed that 
after stemming and stopping a document, long 
runs of cor/tent words cluster. Content word runs 
are a sequence of content words with a function 
word(s) prefix and suffix. These runs can be 
weighted for density in a stopped document and 
vector processed. We observed that these long 
content word runs generally originate from the 
prepositional phrase and subject complement 
positions, providing a linguistic basis for a dense 
neighbourhood of long runs of content words 
signalling a semantic locus of the writing. We 
suppose that these neighbourhoods may contain 
main ideas of the text. In order to verify this, we 
designed a methodology to incorporate semantic 
features into information retrieval and examined 
long runs of content words as a semantic 
predictor. 
We examined all the long runs of the Jang 
(1997) collection and discovered most of them 
originate from the prepositional phrase and 
subject complement positions. According to 
Halliday (1985), a preposition is explained as a 
minor verb. It functions as a minor Predicator 
having a nominal group as its complement. Thus 
the internal structure of 'across the lake' is like 
that of 'crossing the lake', with a non-finite 
verb as Predicator (thus our choice of _> 3 words 
as a long run). When we interpret the 
preposition as a "minor Predicator" and "minor 
Process", we are interpreting the prepositional 
phrase as a kind of minor clause. That is, 
prepositional phrases function as a clause and 
their role is predication. 
Traditionally, predication is what a statement 
says about its subject. A named predication 
corresponds to an externally defined function, 
namely what the speaker intends to say his or 
her subject, i.e. their referent. If long runs 
largely appear in predication positions, it would 
suggest that the speaker is saying something 
important and the longer runs of content words 
would signal a locus of the speaker's intention. 
Extending from the statistical analysis of Jang 
(1997) and our observations of those long runs 
in the collection, we give a basic assumption of 
our study: 
Long runs of content words contain 
significant semantic information that a 
speaker wants to express and focus, 
and thus are semantic indicators or loci 
or main ideas. 
7 
In this paper, we examine the SEMCAT 
values of long and short runs, extracted from a 
random document of the collection in Jang 
(1997), to determine if the SEMCAT weights of 
long runs of content words are semantic 
predictors. 
2.2 SEMCATs 
We adopted Roget's Thesaurus for our basic 
semantic categories (SEMCATs). We extracted 
the semantic categories from the online 
Thesaurus for convenience. We employ the 39 
intermediate categories as basic semantic 
information, since the 6 main categories are too 
general, and the many sub-categories are too 
narrow to be taken into account. We refer to 
these 39 categories as SEMCATs.

2.3 Indexing Space and Stop Lists 
Many of the most frequently occurring words in 
English, such as "the," "of, .... and," "to," etc. are 
non-discriminators with respect to information 
filtering. Since many of these function words 
make up a large fraction of the text of most 
documents, their early elimination in the 
indexing process speeds processing, saves 
significant amounts of index space and does not 
compromise the filtering process. In the Brown 
Corpus, the frequency of stop words is 551,057 
out of 1,013,644 total words. Function words 
therefore account for about 54.5% of the tokens 
in a document. 
The Brown Corpus is useful in text retrieval 
because it is small and efficiently exposes 
content word runs. Furthermore, minimizing the 
document token size is very important in NLP- 
based methods, because NLP-based methods 
usually need much larger indexing spaces than 
statistical-based methods due to processes for 
tagging and parsing. 
3 Experimental Basis 
In order to verify that long runs contribute to 
resolve semantic complexities and can be used 
as predictors of semantic intent, we employed a 
probabilistic, vector processing methodology. 
3.1 Revised Probability and Vector Processing 
In order to understand the calculation of 
SEMCATs, it is helpful to look at the structure 
8 
of a preprocessed document. One document 
"Barbie" in the Jang (1997) collection has a total 
of 1,468 words comprised of 755 content words 
and 713 function words. The document has 17 
paragraphs. Filtering out function words using 
the Brown Corpus exposed the runs of content 
words as shown in Figure 1. 
Figurel: Preprocessed Text Document

DETRACTORS LOVE * * * PLASTIC 
PERFECTION * * FASHION DOLL * *

SALES * * * TALL MANNEQUIN * BARBIE * *

POISED * STRUT * * * CHANGE * * MALE

In Figure 1, asterisks occupy positions where 
function words were filtered out. The bold type 
indicates the location of the longest runs of 
content words. The run length distribution of 
Figure 1 is shown below:

The traditional vector processing model 
requires the following set of terms: 
• (dO the number of documents in the 
collection that each word occurs in 
• (idf) the inverse document frequency of each 
word determined by logl0(N/df) where N is 
the total number of documents. If a word 
appears in a query but not in a document, its 
idf is undefined. 
• The category probability of each query 
word. 
Wendlandt (1991) points out that it is useful to 
retrieve a set of documents based upon key 
words only, and then considers only those 
documents for semantic category and attribute 
analysis. Wendlandt (1991) appends the s 
category weights to the t term weights of each 
document vector Di and the Query vector Q. 
Since our basic query unit is a paragraph, 
document frequencY (df) and inverse document 
frequency (idf) have to be redefined. As we 
pointed out in Section 1, all terms are not known 
in partial text retrieval. Further, our approach is 
based on semantic weight rather than word 
frequency. Therefore any frequency based 
measures defined by Boyd et al. (1994) and 
Wendlandt (1991) need to be built from the 
probabilities of individual semantic categories. 
Those modifications are described below. As a 
simplifying assumption, we assume SEMCATs 
have a uniform probability distribution with 
regard to a word. 
3.2 Calculating SEMCATs 
Our first task in computing SEMCAT values 
was to create a SEMCAT dictionary for our 
method. We extracted SEMCATs for every 
word from the World Wide Web version of 
Roget's thesaurus. SEMCATs give probabilities 
of a word corresponding to a semantic category. 
The content word run 'favorite companion 
detractors love' is of length 4. Each word of the 
run maps to at least one SEMCAT. The word 
'favorite' maps to categories 'PEAF and SYAF'. 
'companion' maps to categories 'ANT, MECO, 
NUM, ORD, ORGM, PEAF, PRVO, QUAN, 
and SYAF'. 'detractor' maps to 'MOAF'. 'love' 
maps to 'AFIG, ANT, MECO, MOAF, MOCO, 
ORGM, PEAF, PORE, PRVO, SYAF, and 
VOIG'. We treat the long runs as a semantic 
core from which to calculate SEMCAT values. 
SEMCAT weights are calculated based on the 
following equations. 
Eq.1 Pjk(Probability) - The likelihood of 
SEMCAT Sj occurring due to the K th 
trigger. For example, assuming a 
uniform probability distribution, the 
category PEAF triggered by the word 
favorite above, has the following 
probability: 
PPEAF, favorite ---- 0.5(1/2) 
Eq.2 Swj (SEMCAT Weights in Long runs) 
is the sum of each SEMCAT(j) weight 
of long runs based on their probabilities. 
In the above example, the long run 
9 
'favorite companion detractors love,' ihe 
SEMCAT 'MOAF' has SWMoAv : 
(detractor(l) + love(.09)) = 1.09. We 
can write; 
Swj= £ PO 
i=1 
Eq.3 edwj (Expected data weights in a 
paragraph) - Given a set of N content 
words (data) in a paragraph, the 
expected weight of the SEMCATs of 
long runs in a paragraph is: 
N 
edwj = E Po 
i=1 
Eq.4 idwj (Inverse data weights in a 
paragraph) - The inverse data weight of 
SEMCATs of long runs for a set of N 
content words in a paragraph is 
idwj= loglo((e~wj\]) 
Eq.5 Weight(Wj) - The weight of SEMCAT 
Sj in.a paragraph is 
Wj = Swjxidwj 
Eq.6 Relevance Weights (Semantic 
Coherence) 
W=£ W 0 
i=1 
Our method performs the following steps: 
1. calculate the SEMCAT weight of each long 
content word run in every paragraph (Sw) 
2. calculate the expected data weight of each 
paragraph (edw) 
3. calculate the inverse expected data weight of 
each paragraph (idw) 
4. calculate the actual weight of each 
paragraph (Swxidw) 
5. calculate coherence weights (total relevance) 
by summing the weights of (Swxidw). 
In every paragraph, extraction of SEMCATs 
from long runs is done first. The next step is 
finding the same SEMCATs of long runs 
through every word in a paragraph (expected 
data weight), then calculate idw, and finally 
Sw×idw. The final, total relevance weights are 
an accumulation of all weights of SEMCATs of 
content words in a paragraph. Total relevance 
tells how many SEMCATs of the Query's long 
runs appear in a paragraph. Higher values imply 
that the paragraph is relevant to the long runs of 
the Query. 
The following is a program output for 
calculating SEMCAT weights for an arbitrary 
long run: "SEVEN INTERACTIVE 
PRODUCTS LED"

4 Experimental Results 
The goal of employing probability and vector 
processing is to prove the linguistic basis that 
long runs of content words can be used as 
predictors of semantic intent But we also want to 
exploit the computational advantage of 
removing the function words from the 
document, which reduces the number of tokens 
processed by about 50% and thus reduces vector 
space and probability computations. If it is true 
that long runs of content words are predictors of 
semantic coherence, we can further reduce the 
complexity of vector computations: (1) by 
eliminating those paragraphs without long runs 
from consideration, (2) within remaining 
paragraphs with long runs, computing and 
summing the semantic coherence of the longest 
runs only, (3) ranking the eligible paragraphs for 
retrieval based upon their semantic weights 
relative to the query. 
Jang (1997) established that the distribution 
of long runs of content words and short runs of 
content words in a collection of paragraphs are 
drawn from different populations. This implies 
10 
that either long runs or short runs are predictors, 
but since all paragraphs contain short runs, i.e. a 
single content word separated by function 
words, only long runs can be useful predictors. 
Furthermore, only long runs as we define them 
can be used as predictors because short runs are 
insufficient to construct the language constructs 
for prepositional phrase and subject complement 
positions. If short runs were discriminators, the 
linguistic assumption of this research would be 
violated. The statistical analysis of Jang (1997) 
does not indicate this to be the case. 
To proceed in establishing the viability of 
our approach, we proposed the following 
experimental hypotheses: 
(HI) The SEMCAT weights for long runs 
of content words are statistically greater 
than weights for short runs of content 
words. Since each content word can map 
to multiple SEMCATs, we cannot 
assume that the semantic weight of a 
long run is a function of its length. The 
semantic coherence of long runs should 
be a more granular discriminator. 
(H2) For paragraphs containing long runs 
and short runs, the distribution of long 
run SEMCAT weights is statistically 
different from the distribution of short 
run SEMCAT weights. 
(H3) There is a positive correlation 
between the sum of long run SEMCAT 
weights and the semantic coherence of a 
paragraph, the total paragraph SEMCAT 
weight. 
A detailed description of these experiments 
and their outcome are described in Shin (1997, 
1999). The results of the experiments and the 
implications of those results relative to the 
method we propose are discussed below. Table 3 
gives the SEMCAT weights for seventeen 
paragraphs randomly chosen from one document 
in the collection of Jang (1997).

At the .05 significance level, Fa _ .o5 = 4.49 for 
1,16 degrees of freedom. Since 68.56 > 4.49 we 
reject the assertion that column means (run 
weights) are equal in Table 2. Long run and 
short run weights come from different 
• populations. We accept HI. 
For the between paragraph treatment, the 
row means (paragraph weights) have an F value 
of 2.21. At the .05 significance level, F,~ = 05 = 
2.28 for 16,16 degrees of freedom. Since 2.21 < 
2.28 we cannot reject the assertion that there is 
no significant difference in SEMCAT weights 
between paragraphs. That is, paragraph weights 
do not appear to be taken from different 
populations, as do the long run and short run 
weight distributions. Thus, the semantic weight 
11 
of the content words in a paragraph cannot be 
used to predict the semantic weight of the 
paragraph. We therefore proceed to examine H2. 
Notice that two paragraphs in Table 2 are 
without long runs. We need to repeat the 
analysis of variance for only those paragraphs 
with long runs to see if long runs are 
discriminators. Table 5 summarizes those 
paragraphs.

paragraphs in a collection containing both long

long runs and short runs are drawn from 
different distributions. We accept H2. 
For paragraphs containing long runs and 
short runs, the distributions of long run 
SEMCAT weights is different from the 
distribution of short run SEMCAT weights. We 
know from the linguistic basis for long runs that 
short runs cannot be used as predictors. We 
therefore proceed to examine the Pearson 
correlation between the long run SEMCAT 
weights and paragraph SEMCAT weights for 
those paragraphs with both long and short 
content word runs.

5. Conclusion 
This research tested three statistical hypotheses 
extending from two observations: (1) Jang 
(1997) observed the clustering of long runs of 
content words and established the distribution of 
long run lengths and short run lengths are drawn 
from different populations, (2) our observation 
that these long runs of content words originate 
from the prepositional phrase and subject 
complement positions. According to Halliday 
(1985) those grammar structures function as 
12 
minor predication and as such are loci of 
semantic intent or coherence. In order to 
facilitate the use of long runs as predictors, we 
modified the traditional measures of Boyd et al. 
(1994), Wendlandt (1991) to accommodate 
semantic categories and partial text retrieval. 
The revised metrics and the computational 
method we propose were used in the statistical 
experiments presented above. The main findings 
of this work are 
1. the distribution semantic coherence 
(SEMCAT weights) of long runs is not 
statistically greater than that of short 
runs, 
2. for paragraphs containing both long runs 
and short runs, the SEMCAT weight 
distributions are drawn from different 
populations 
3. there is a positive correlation between 
the sum of long run SEMCAT weights 
and the total SEMCAT weight of the 
paragraph (its semantic coherence). 
Significant additional work is required to 
validate these preliminary results. The collection 
employed in Jang (1997) is not a standard 
Corpus so we have no way to test precision and 
relevance of the proposed method. The results of 
the proposed method are subject to the accuracy 
of the stop lists and filtering function. 
Nonetheless, we feel the approach proposed 
has potential to improve performance through 
reduced token processing and increased 
relevance through consideration of semantic 
coherence of long runs. Significantly, our 
approach does not require knowledge of the 
collection.
