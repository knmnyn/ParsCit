The task of Semantic Role Labeling 
(SRL) is often divided into two sub-tasks: 
verb argument identification, and argu-
ment classification. Current SRL algo-
rithms show lower results on the identifi-
cation sub-task. Moreover, most SRL al-
gorithms are supervised, relying on large 
amounts of manually created data. In 
this paper we present an unsupervised al-
gorithm for identifying verb arguments, 
where the only type of annotation required 
is POS tagging. The algorithm makes use 
of a fully unsupervised syntactic parser, 
using its output in order to detect clauses 
and gather candidate argument colloca-
tion statistics. We evaluate our algorithm 
on PropBank10, achieving a precision of 
56%, as opposed to 47% of a strong base-
line. We also obtain an 8% increase in 
precision for a Spanish corpus. This is 
the first paper that tackles unsupervised 
verb argument identification without using 
manually encoded rules or extensive lexi-
cal or syntactic resources.

1 Introduction
# Para 31 5
Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a major NLP 
task, providing a shallow sentence-level semantic 
analysis. SRL aims at identifying the relations be-
tween the predicates (usually, verbs) in the sen-
tence and their associated arguments.
# Para 36 5
The SRL task is often viewed as consisting of 
two parts: argument identification (ARGID) and ar-
gument classification. The former aims at identi-
fying the arguments of a given predicate present 
in the sentence, while the latter determines the 
# Para 41 10
type of relation that holds between the identi-
fied arguments and their corresponding predicates. 
The division into two sub-tasks is justified by 
the fact that they are best addressed using differ-
ent feature sets (Pradhan et al., 2005). Perfor-
mance in the ARGID stage is a serious bottleneck 
for general SRL performance, since only about 
81% of the arguments are identified, while about 
95% of the identified arguments are labeled cor-
rectly (M`arquez et al., 2008).
# Para 51 12
SRL is a complex task, which is reflected by the 
algorithms used to address it. A standard SRL al-
gorithm requires thousands to dozens of thousands 
sentences annotated with POS tags, syntactic an-
notation and SRL annotation. Current algorithms 
show impressive results but only for languages and 
domains where plenty of annotated data is avail-
able, e.g., English newspaper texts (see Section 2). 
Results are markedly lower when testing is on a 
domain wider than the training one, even in En-
glish (see the WSJ-Brown results in (Pradhan et 
al., 2008)).
# Para 63 8
Only a small number of works that do not re-
quire manually labeled SRL training data have 
been done (Swier and Stevenson, 2004; Swier and 
Stevenson, 2005; Grenager and Manning, 2006). 
These papers have replaced this data with the 
VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) lexical resource or 
a set of manually written rules and supervised 
parsers.
# Para 71 5
A potential answer to the SRL training data bot-
tleneck are unsupervised SRL models that require 
little to no manual effort for their training. Their 
output can be used either by itself, or as training 
material for modern supervised SRL algorithms.
# Para 76 3
In this paper we present an algorithm for unsu-
pervised argument identification. The only type of 
annotation required by our algorithm is POS tag-

ging, which needs relatively little manual effort.
# Para 83 16
The algorithm consists of two stages. As pre-
processing, we use a fully unsupervised parser to 
parse each sentence. Initially, the set of possi-
ble arguments for a given verb consists of all the 
constituents in the parse tree that do not contain 
that predicate. The first stage of the algorithm 
attempts to detect the minimal clause in the sen-
tence that contains the predicate in question. Us-
ing this information, it further reduces the possible 
arguments only to those contained in the minimal 
clause, and further prunes them according to their 
position in the parse tree. In the second stage we 
use pointwise mutual information to estimate the 
collocation strength between the arguments and 
the predicate, and use it to filter out instances of 
weakly collocating predicate argument pairs.
# Para 99 11
We use two measures to evaluate the perfor-
mance of our algorithm, precision and F-score. 
Precision reflects the algorithm’s applicability for 
creating training data to be used by supervised 
SRL models, while the standard SRL F-score mea-
sures the model’s performance when used by it-
self. The first stage of our algorithm is shown to 
outperform a strong baseline both in terms of F- 
score and of precision. The second stage is shown 
to increase precision while maintaining a reason-
able recall.
# Para 110 15
We evaluated our model on sections 2-21 of 
Propbank. As is customary in unsupervised pars-
ing work (e.g. (Seginer, 2007)), we bounded sen-
tence length by 10 (excluding punctuation). Our 
first stage obtained a precision of 52.8%, which is 
more than 6% improvement over the baseline. Our 
second stage improved precision to nearly 56%, a 
9.3% improvement over the baseline. In addition, 
we carried out experiments on Spanish (on sen-
tences of length bounded by 15, excluding punctu-
ation), achieving an increase of over 7.5% in pre-
cision over the baseline. Our algorithm increases 
F–score as well, showing an 1.8% improvement 
over the baseline in English and a 2.2% improve-
ment in Spanish.

2 Related Work
# Para 129 3
The advance of machine learning based ap-
proaches in this field owes to the usage of large 
scale annotated corpora. English is the most stud-
# Para 132 9
ied language, using the FrameNet (FN) (Baker et 
al., 1998) and PropBank (PB) (Palmer et al., 2005) 
resources. PB is a corpus well suited for evalu-
ation, since it annotates every non-auxiliary verb 
in a real corpus (the WSJ sections of the Penn 
Treebank). PB is a standard corpus for SRL eval-
uation and was used in the CoNLL SRL shared 
tasks of 2004 (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004) and 
2005 (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005).
# Para 141 8
Most work on SRL has been supervised, requir-
ing dozens of thousands of SRL annotated train-
ing sentences. In addition, most models assume 
that a syntactic representation of the sentence is 
given, commonly in the form of a parse tree, a de-
pendency structure or a shallow parse. Obtaining 
these is quite costly in terms of required human 
annotation.
# Para 149 11
The first work to tackle SRL as an indepen-
dent task is (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), which 
presented a supervised model trained and evalu-
ated on FrameNet. The CoNLL shared tasks of 
2004 and 2005 were devoted to SRL, and stud-
ied the influence of different syntactic annotations 
and domain changes on SRL results. Computa-
tional Linguistics has recently published a special 
issue on the task (M`arquez et al., 2008), which 
presents state-of-the-art results and surveys the lat-
est achievements and challenges in the field.
# Para 160 12
Most approaches to the task use a multi-level 
approach, separating the task to an ARGID and an 
argument classification sub-tasks. They then use 
the unlabeled argument structure (without the se-
mantic roles) as training data for the ARGID stage 
and the entire data (perhaps with other features) 
for the classification stage. Better performance 
is achieved on the classification, where state- 
of-the-art supervised approaches achieve about 
81% F-score on the in-domain identification task, 
of which about 95% are later labeled correctly 
(M`arquez et al., 2008).
# Para 172 11
There have been several exceptions to the stan-
dard architecture described in the last paragraph. 
One suggestion poses the problem of SRL as a se-
quential tagging of words, training an SVM clas-
sifier to determine for each word whether it is in-
side, outside or in the beginning of an argument 
(Hacioglu and Ward, 2003). Other works have in-
tegrated argument classification and identification 
into one step (Collobert and Weston, 2007), while 
others went further and combined the former two 
along with parsing into a single model (Musillo
# Para 183 1

and Merlo, 2006).
# Para 185 15
Work on less supervised methods has been 
scarce. Swier and Stevenson (2004) and Swier 
and Stevenson (2005) presented the first model 
that does not use an SRL annotated corpus. How-
ever, they utilize the extensive verb lexicon Verb- 
Net, which lists the possible argument structures 
allowable for each verb, and supervised syntac-
tic tools. Using VerbNet along with the output of 
a rule-based chunker (in 2004) and a supervised 
syntactic parser (in 2005), they spot instances in 
the corpus that are very similar to the syntactic 
patterns listed in VerbNet. They then use these as 
seed for a bootstrapping algorithm, which conse-
quently identifies the verb arguments in the corpus 
and assigns their semantic roles.
# Para 200 11
Another less supervised work is that 
of (Grenager and Manning, 2006), which presents 
a Bayesian network model for the argument 
structure of a sentence. They use EM to learn 
the model’s parameters from unannotated data, 
and use this model to tag a test corpus. However, 
ARGID was not the task of that work, which dealt 
solely with argument classification. ARGID was 
performed by manually-created rules, requiring a 
supervised or manual syntactic annotation of the 
corpus to be annotated.
# Para 211 6
The three works above are relevant but incom-
parable to our work, due to the extensive amount 
of supervision (namely, VerbNet and a rule-based 
or supervised syntactic system) they used, both in 
detecting the syntactic structure and in detecting 
the arguments.
# Para 217 11
Work has been carried out in a few other lan-
guages besides English. Chinese has been studied 
in (Xue, 2008). Experiments on Catalan and Span-
ish were done in SemEval 2007 (M`arquez et al., 
2007) with two participating systems. Attempts 
to compile corpora for German (Burdchardt et al., 
2006) and Arabic (Diab et al., 2008) are also un-
derway. The small number of languages for which 
extensive SRL annotated data exists reflects the 
considerable human effort required for such en-
deavors.
# Para 228 7
Some SRL works have tried to use unannotated 
data to improve the performance of a base su-
pervised model. Methods used include bootstrap-
ping approaches (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Kate 
and Mooney, 2007), where large unannotated cor-
pora were tagged with SRL annotation, later to 
be used to retrain the SRL model. Another ap-
# Para 235 8
 proach used similarity measures either between 
verbs (Gordon and Swanson, 2007) or between 
nouns (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) to overcome 
lexical sparsity. These measures were estimated 
using statistics gathered from corpora augmenting 
the model’s training data, and were then utilized 
to generalize across similar verbs or similar argu-
ments.
# Para 243 12
Attempts to substitute full constituency pars-
ing by other sources of syntactic information have 
been carried out in the SRL community. Sugges-
tions include posing SRL as a sequence labeling 
problem (M`arquez et al., 2005) or as an edge tag-
ging problem in a dependency representation (Ha-
cioglu, 2004). Punyakanok et al. (2008) provide 
a detailed comparison between the impact of us-
ing shallow vs. full constituency syntactic infor-
mation in an English SRL system. Their results 
clearly demonstrate the advantage of using full an-
notation.
# Para 255 12
The identification of arguments has also been 
carried out in the context of automatic subcatego-
rization frame acquisition. Notable examples in-
clude (Manning, 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; 
Korhonen, 2002) who all used statistical hypothe-
sis testing to filter a parser’s output for arguments, 
with the goal of compiling verb subcategorization 
lexicons. However, these works differ from ours 
as they attempt to characterize the behavior of a 
verb type, by collecting statistics from various in-
stances of that verb, and not to determine which 
are the arguments of specific verb instances.
# Para 267 8
The algorithm presented in this paper performs 
unsupervised clause detection as an intermedi-
ate step towards argument identification. Super-
vised clause detection was also tackled as a sepa-
rate task, notably in the CoNLL 2001 shared task 
(Tjong Kim Sang and D`ejean, 2001). Clause in-
formation has been applied to accelerating a syn-
tactic parser (Glaysher and Moldovan, 2006).

3 Algorithm
# Para 276 5
In this section we describe our algorithm. It con-
sists of two stages, each of which reduces the set 
of argument candidates, which a-priori contains all 
consecutive sequences of words that do not con-
tain the predicate in question.
# Para 281 1
3.1 Algorithm overview
# Para 282 2
As pre-processing, we use an unsupervised parser 
that generates an unlabeled parse tree for each sen-

tence (Seginer, 2007). This parser is unique in that 
it is able to induce a bracketing (unlabeled pars-
ing) from raw text (without even using POS tags) 
achieving state-of-the-art results. Since our algo-
rithm uses millions to tens of millions sentences, 
we must use very fast tools. The parser’s high 
speed (thousands of words per second) enables us 
to process these large amounts of data.
# Para 293 5
The only type of supervised annotation we 
use is POS tagging. We use the taggers MX- 
POST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for English and Tree-
Tagger (Schmid, 1994) for Spanish, to obtain POS 
tags for our model.
# Para 298 11
The first stage of our algorithm uses linguisti-
cally motivated considerations to reduce the set of 
possible arguments. It does so by confining the set 
of argument candidates only to those constituents 
which obey the following two restrictions. First, 
they should be contained in the minimal clause 
containing the predicate. Second, they should be 
k-th degree cousins of the predicate in the parse 
tree. We propose a novel algorithm for clause de-
tection and use its output to determine which of 
the constituents obey these two restrictions.
# Para 309 8
The second stage of the algorithm uses point- 
wise mutual information to rule out constituents 
that appear to be weakly collocating with the pred-
icate in question. Since a predicate greatly re-
stricts the type of arguments with which it may 
appear (this is often referred to as “selectional re-
strictions”), we expect it to have certain character-
istic arguments with which it is likely to collocate.
# Para 317 1
3.2 Clause detection stage
# Para 318 16
The main idea behind this stage is the observation 
that most of the arguments of a predicate are con-
tained within the minimal clause that contains the 
predicate. We tested this on our development data 
– section 24 of the WSJ PTB, where we saw that 
86% of the arguments that are also constituents 
(in the gold standard parse) were indeed contained 
in that minimal clause (as defined by the tree la-
bel types in the gold standard parse that denote 
a clause, e.g., S, SBAR). Since we are not pro-
vided with clause annotation (or any label), we at-
tempted to detect them in an unsupervised manner. 
Our algorithm attempts to find sub-trees within the 
parse tree, whose structure resembles the structure 
of a full sentence. This approximates the notion of 
a clause.

ancestor.
# Para 342 12
Statistics gathering. In order to detect which 
of the verb’s ancestors is the minimal clause, we 
score each of the ancestors and select the one that 
maximizes the score. We represent each ancestor 
using its Spinal Tree (ST). The ST of a given 
verb’s ancestor is obtained by replacing all the 
constituents that do not contain the verb by a leaf 
having a label. This effectively encodes all the k-
th degree cousins of the verb (for every k). The 
leaf labels are either the word’s POS in case the 
constituent is a leaf, or the generic label “L” de-
noting a non-leaf. See Figure 1 for an example.
# Para 354 6
In this stage we collect statistics of the occur-
rences of STs in a large corpus. For every ST in 
the corpus, we count the number of times it oc-
curs in a form we consider to be a clause (positive 
examples), and the number of times it appears in 
other forms (negative examples).
# Para 360 9
Positive examples are divided into two main 
types. First, when the ST encodes the root an-
cestor (as in the middle tree of Figure 1); second, 
when the ancestor complies to a clause lexico-
syntactic pattern. In many languages there is a 
small set of lexico-syntactic patterns that mark a 
clause, e.g. the English ‘that’, the German ‘dass’ 
and the Spanish ‘que’. The patterns which were 
used in our experiments are shown in Figure 2.

update the following counters: sentence(5T) for 
the root ancestor’s 5T, patternz (5T) for the ones

negative(5T) for the other ancestors1.
# Para 411 11
Clause detection. At test time, when detecting 
the minimal clause of a verb instance, we use 
the statistics collected in the previous stage. De-
note the ancestors of the verb with A1 ... Am. 
For each of them, we calculate clause(5TA, ) 
and total (5TA, ). clause(5TA,) is the sum 
of sentence(5TA,) and patternz (5TA,) if this 
ancestor complies to the i-th pattern (if there 
is no such pattern, clause(5TA,) is equal to 
sentence (5TA, )). total (5TA,) is the sum of 
clause(5TA,) and negative(5TA, ).

An 5T whose total(5T) is less than a small 
threshold2 is not considered a candidate to be the 
minimal clause, since its statistics may be un-
reliable. In case of a tie, we choose the low-
est constituent that obtained the maximal score.
# Para 430 6
1If while traversing the tree, we encounter an ancestor 
whose first word is preceded by a coordinating conjunction 
(marked by the POS tag “CC”), we refrain from performing 
any additional counter updates. Structures containing coor-
dinating conjunctions tend not to obey our lexico-syntactic 
rules.
# Para 436 2
2We used 4 per million sentences, derived from develop-
ment data.
# Para 438 6
If there is only one verb in the sentence3 or if 
clause(5TA,) = 0 for every 1 G j G m, we 
choose the top level constituent by default to be 
the minimal clause containing the verb. Other-
wise, the minimal clause is defined to be the yield 
of the selected ancestor.
# Para 444 10
Argument identification. For each predicate in 
the corpus, its argument candidates are now de-
fined to be the constituents contained in the min-
imal clause containing the predicate. However, 
these constituents may be (and are) nested within 
each other, violating a major restriction on SRL 
arguments. Hence we now prune our set, by keep-
ing only the siblings of all of the verb’s ancestors, 
as is common in supervised SRL (Xue and Palmer, 
2004).
# Para 454 1
3.3 Using collocations
# Para 455 5
We use the following observation to filter out some 
superfluous argument candidates: since the argu-
ments of a predicate many times bear a semantic 
connection with that predicate, they consequently 
tend to collocate with it.
# Para 460 8
We collect collocation statistics from a large 
corpus, which we annotate with parse trees and 
POS tags. We mark arguments using the argu-
ment detection algorithm described in the previous 
two sections, and extract all (predicate, argument) 
pairs appearing in the corpus. Recall that for each 
sentence, the arguments are a subset of the con-
stituents in the parse tree.
# Para 468 5
We use two representations of an argument: one 
is the POS tag sequence of the terminals contained 
in the argument, the other is its head word4. The 
predicate is represented as the conjunction of its 
lemma with its POS tag.
# Para 473 8
Denote the number of times a predicate x 
appeared with an argument y by nxy. Denote 
the total number of (predicate, argument) pairs 
by N. Using these notations, we define the 
following quantities: nx = Eynxy, ny = Exnxy, 
p(x) = n�N , p(y) = n�N and p(x, y) = nx N . The 
pointwise mutual information of x and y is then 
given by:
# Para 481 2
3In this case, every argument in the sentence must be re-
lated to that verb.
# Para 483 4
4Since we do not have syntactic labels, we use an approx-
imate notion. For English we use the Bikel parser default 
head word rules (Bikel, 2004). For Spanish, we use the left-
most word.

# Para 489 1
(n� �ny)/N
# Para 490 4
PMI effectively measures the ratio between 
the number of times x and y appeared together and 
the number of times they were expected to appear, 
had they been independent.
# Para 494 7
At test time, when an (x, y) pair is observed, we 
check if PMI (x, y), computed on the large cor-
pus, is lower than a threshold a for either of x’s 
representations. If this holds, for at least one rep-
resentation, we prune all instances of that (x, y) 
pair. The parameter a may be selected differently 
for each of the argument representations.
# Para 501 1
In order to avoid using unreliable statistics,
# Para 502 4
we apply this for a given pair only if n .ny N&gt;
r, for some parameter r. That is, we consider
PMI (x, y) to be reliable, only if the denomina-
tor in equation (2) is sufficiently large.

4 Experimental Setup
# Para 507 20
Corpora. We used the PropBank corpus for de-
velopment and for evaluation on English. Section 
24 was used for the development of our model, 
and sections 2 to 21 were used as our test data. 
The free parameters of the collocation extraction 
phase were tuned on the development data. Fol-
lowing the unsupervised parsing literature, multi-
ple brackets and brackets covering a single word 
are omitted. We exclude punctuation according 
to the scheme of (Klein, 2005). As is customary 
in unsupervised parsing (e.g. (Seginer, 2007)), we 
bounded the lengths of the sentences in the cor-
pus to be at most 10 (excluding punctuation). This 
results in 207 sentences in the development data, 
containing a total of 132 different verbs and 173 
verb instances (of the non-auxiliary verbs in the 
SRL task, see ‘evaluation’ below) having 403 ar-
guments. The test data has 6007 sentences con-
taining 1008 different verbs and 5130 verb in-
stances (as above) having 12436 arguments.
# Para 527 11
Our algorithm requires large amounts of data 
to gather argument structure and collocation pat-
terns. For the statistics gathering phase of the 
clause detection algorithm, we used 4.5M sen-
tences of the NANC (Graff, 1995) corpus, bound-
ing their length in the same manner. In order 
to extract collocations, we used 2M sentences 
from the British National Corpus (Burnard, 2000) 
and about 29M sentences from the Dmoz cor-
pus (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2005). Dmoz 
is a web corpus obtained by crawling and clean- 
# Para 538 4
ing the URLs in the Open Directory Project 
(dmoz.org). All of the above corpora were parsed 
using Seginer’s parser and POS-tagged by MX- 
POST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
# Para 542 17
For our experiments on Spanish, we used 3.3M 
sentences of length at most 15 (excluding punctua-
tion) extracted from the Spanish Wikipedia. Here 
we chose to bound the length by 15 due to the 
smaller size of the available test corpus. The 
same data was used both for the first and the sec-
ond stages. Our development and test data were 
taken from the training data released for the Se-
mEval 2007 task on semantic annotation of Span-
ish (M`arquez et al., 2007). This data consisted 
of 1048 sentences of length up to 15, from which 
200 were randomly selected as our development 
data and 848 as our test data. The development 
data included 313 verb instances while the test 
data included 1279. All corpora were parsed us-
ing the Seginer parser and tagged by the “Tree-
Tagger” (Schmid, 1994).

Baselines. Since this is the first paper, to our 
knowledge, which addresses the problem of unsu-
pervised argument identification, we do not have 
any previous results to compare to. We instead 
compare to a baseline which marks all k-th degree 
cousins of the predicate (for every k) as arguments 
(this is the second pruning we use in the clause 
detection stage). We name this baseline the ALL 
COUSINS baseline. We note that a random base-
line would score very poorly since any sequence of 
terminals which does not contain the predicate is 
a possible candidate. Therefore, beating this ran-
dom baseline is trivial.
# Para 572 16
Evaluation. Evaluation is carried out using 
standard SRL evaluation software5. The algorithm 
is provided with a list of predicates, whose argu-
ments it needs to annotate. For the task addressed 
in this paper, non-consecutive parts of arguments 
are treated as full arguments. A match is consid-
ered each time an argument in the gold standard 
data matches a marked argument in our model’s 
output. An unmatched argument is an argument 
which appears in the gold standard data, and fails 
to appear in our model’s output, and an exces-
sive argument is an argument which appears in 
our model’s output but does not appear in the gold 
standard. Precision and recall are defined accord-
ingly. We report an F-score as well (the harmonic 
mean of precision and recall). We do not attempt

to identify multi-word verbs, and therefore do not 
report the model’s performance in identifying verb 
boundaries.
# Para 593 13
Since our model detects clauses as an interme-
diate product, we provide a separate evaluation 
of this task for the English corpus. We show re-
sults on our development data. We use the stan-
dard parsing F-score evaluation measure. As a 
gold standard in this evaluation, we mark for each 
of the verbs in our development data the minimal 
clause containing it. A minimal clause is the low-
est ancestor of the verb in the parse tree that has 
a syntactic label of a clause according to the gold 
standard parse of the PTB. A verb is any terminal 
marked by one of the POS tags of type verb ac-
cording to the gold standard POS tags of the PTB.

5 Results
# Para 607 8
Our results are shown in Table 1. The left section 
presents results on English and the right section 
presents results on Spanish. The top line lists re-
sults of the clause detection stage alone. The next 
two lines list results of the full algorithm (clause 
detection + collocations) in two different settings 
of the collocation stage. The bottom line presents 
the performance of the ALL COUSINS baseline.
# Para 615 9
In the “Collocation Maximum Precision” set-
ting the parameters of the collocation stage (a and 
r) were generally tuned such that maximal preci-
sion is achieved while preserving a minimal recall 
level (40% for English, 20% for Spanish on the de-
velopment data). In the “Collocation Maximum F- 
score” the collocation parameters were generally 
tuned such that the maximum possible F-score for 
the collocation algorithm is achieved.
# Para 624 9
The best or close to best F-score is achieved 
when using the clause detection algorithm alone 
(59.14% for English, 23.34% for Spanish). Note 
that for both English and Spanish F-score im-
provements are achieved via a precision improve-
ment that is more significant than the recall degra-
dation. F-score maximization would be the aim of 
a system that uses the output of our unsupervised 
ARGID by itself.
# Para 633 7
The “Collocation Maximum Precision” 
achieves the best precision level (55.97% for 
English, 21.8% for Spanish) but at the expense 
of the largest recall loss. Still, it maintains a 
reasonable level of recall. The “Collocation 
Maximum F-score” is an example of a model that 
provides a precision improvement (over both the 
# Para 640 5
baseline and the clause detection stage) with a 
relatively small recall degradation. In the Spanish 
experiments its F-score (23.87%) is even a bit 
higher than that of the clause detection stage 
(23.34%).
# Para 645 5
The full two–stage algorithm (clause detection 
+ collocations) should thus be used when we in-
tend to use the model’s output as training data for 
supervised SRL engines or supervised ARGID al-
gorithms.
# Para 650 14
In our algorithm, the initial set of potential ar-
guments consists of constituents in the Seginer 
parser’s parse tree. Consequently the fraction 
of arguments that are also constituents (81.87% 
for English and 51.83% for Spanish) poses an 
upper bound on our algorithm’s recall. Note 
that the recall of the ALL COUSINS baseline is 
74.27% (45.75%) for English (Spanish). This 
score emphasizes the baseline’s strength, and jus-
tifies the restriction that the arguments should be 
k-th cousins of the predicate. The difference be-
tween these bounds for the two languages provides 
a partial explanation for the corresponding gap in 
the algorithm’s performance.
# Para 664 10
Figure 3 shows the precision of the collocation 
model (on development data) as a function of the 
amount of data it was given. We can see that 
the algorithm reaches saturation at about 5M sen-
tences. It achieves this precision while maintain-
ing a reasonable recall (an average recall of 43.1% 
after saturation). The parameters of the colloca-
tion model were separately tuned for each corpus 
size, and the graph displays the maximum which 
was obtained for each of the corpus sizes.
# Para 674 10
To better understand our model’s performance, 
we performed experiments on the English cor-
pus to test how well its first stage detects clauses. 
Clause detection is used by our algorithm as a step 
towards argument identification, but it can be of 
potential benefit for other purposes as well (see 
Section 2). The results are 23.88% recall and 40% 
precision. As in the ARGID task, a random se-
lection of arguments would have yielded an ex-
tremely poor result.

In this work we presented the first algorithm for ar-
gument identification that uses neither supervised 
syntactic annotation nor SRL tagged data. We 
have experimented on two languages: English and 
Spanish. The straightforward adaptability of un-

supervised models to different languages is one 
of their most appealing characteristics. The re-
cent availability of unsupervised syntactic parsers 
has offered an opportunity to conduct research on 
SRL, without reliance on supervised syntactic an-
notation. This work is the first to address the ap-
plication of unsupervised parses to an SRL related 
task.
# Para 719 8
Our model displayed an increase in precision of 
9% in English and 8% in Spanish over a strong 
baseline. Precision is of particular interest in this 
context, as instances tagged by high quality an-
notation could be later used as training data for 
supervised SRL algorithms. In terms of F–score, 
our model showed an increase of 1.8% in English 
and of 2.2% in Spanish over the baseline.
# Para 727 7
Although the quality of unsupervised parses is 
currently low (compared to that of supervised ap-
proaches), using great amounts of data in identi-
fying recurring structures may reduce noise and 
in addition address sparsity. The techniques pre-
sented in this paper are based on this observation, 
using around 35M sentences in total for English 
# Para 734 1
and 3.3M sentences for Spanish.
# Para 735 8
As this is the first work which addressed un-
supervised ARGID, many questions remain to be 
explored. Interesting issues to address include as-
sessing the utility of the proposed methods when 
supervised parses are given, comparing our model 
to systems with no access to unsupervised parses 
and conducting evaluation using more relaxed 
measures.
# Para 743 10
Unsupervised methods for syntactic tasks have 
matured substantially in the last few years. No-
table examples are (Clark, 2003) for unsupervised 
POS tagging and (Smith and Eisner, 2006) for un-
supervised dependency parsing. Adapting our al-
gorithm to use the output of these models, either to 
reduce the little supervision our algorithm requires 
(POS tagging) or to provide complementary syn-
tactic information, is an interesting challenge for 
future work.
