Abstract
This paper proposes an approach to en-
hance dependency parsing in a language 
by using a translated treebank from an-
other language. A simple statistical ma-
chine translation method, word-by-word 
decoding, where not a parallel corpus but 
a bilingual lexicon is necessary, is adopted 
for the treebank translation. Using an en-
semble method, the key information ex-
tracted from word pairs with dependency 
relations in the translated text is effectively 
integrated into the parser for the target lan-
guage. The proposed method is evaluated 
in English and Chinese treebanks. It is 
shown that a translated English treebank 
helps a Chinese parser obtain a state-of- 
the-art result.
1 Introduction
Although supervised learning methods bring state- 
of-the-art outcome for dependency parser infer-
ring (McDonald et al., 2005; Hall et al., 2007), a 
large enough data set is often required for specific 
parsing accuracy according to this type of meth-
ods. However, to annotate syntactic structure, ei-
ther phrase- or dependency-based, is a costly job.
Until now, the largest treebanks' in various lan-
guages for syntax learning are with around one 
million words (or some other similar units). Lim-
ited data stand in the way of further performance 
enhancement. This is the case for each individual 
language at least. But, this is not the case as we 
observe all treebanks in different languages as a 
whole. For example, of ten treebanks for CoNLL-
2007 shared task, none includes more than 500K

'It is a tradition to call an annotated syntactic corpus as

tokens, while the sum of tokens from all treebanks 
is about two million (Nivre et al., 2007).
As different human languages or treebanks 
should share something common, this makes it 
possible to let dependency parsing in multiple lan-
guages be beneficial with each other. In this pa-
per, we study how to improve dependency parsing 
by using (automatically) translated texts attached 
with transformed dependency information. As a 
case study, we consider how to enhance a Chinese 
dependency parser by using a translated English 
treebank. What our method relies on is not the 
close relation of the chosen language pair but the 
similarity of two treebanks, this is the most differ-
ent from the previous work.
Two main obstacles are supposed to confront in 
a cross-language dependency parsing task. The 
first is the cost of translation. Machine translation 
has been shown one of the most expensive lan-
guage processing tasks, as a great deal of time and 
space is required to perform this task. In addition, 
a standard statistical machine translation method 
based on a parallel corpus will not work effec-
tively if it is not able to find a parallel corpus that 
right covers source and target treebanks. How-
ever, dependency parsing focuses on the relations 
of word pairs, this allows us to use a dictionary- 
based translation without assuming a parallel cor-
pus available, and the training stage of translation 
may be ignored and the decoding will be quite fast 
in this case. The second difficulty is that the out-
puts of translation are hardly qualified for the pars-
ing purpose. The most challenge in this aspect is 
morphological preprocessing. We regard that the 
morphological issue should be handled aiming at 
the specific language, our solution here is to use 
character-level features for a target language like 
Chinese.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Section 4 describes a dependency parser for Chi-
nese as a baseline. Section 5 describes how a 
parser can be strengthened from the translated 
treebank. The experimental results are reported in 
Section 6. Section 7 looks into a few issues con-
cerning the conditions that the proposed approach 
is suitable for. Section 8 concludes the paper.
2 The Related Work
As this work is about exploiting extra resources to 
enhance an existing parser, it is related to domain 
adaption for parsing that has been draw some in-
terests in recent years. Typical domain adaptation 
tasks often assume annotated data in new domain 
absent or insufficient and a large scale unlabeled 
data available. As unlabeled data are concerned, 
semi-supervised or unsupervised methods will be 
naturally adopted. In previous works, two basic 
types of methods can be identified to enhance an 
existing parser from additional resources. The first 
is usually focus on exploiting automatic generated 
labeled data from the unlabeled data (Steedman 
et al., 2003; McClosky et al., 2006; Reichart and 
Rappoport, 2007; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007; Chen 
et al., 2008), the second is on combining super-
vised and unsupervised methods, and only unla-
beled data are considered (Smith and Eisner, 2006; 
Wang and Schuurmans, 2008; Koo et al., 2008).
Our purpose in this study is to obtain a further 
performance enhancement by exploiting treebanks 
in other languages. This is similar to the above 
first type of methods, some assistant data should 
be automatically generated for the subsequent pro-
cessing. The differences are what type of data are 
concerned with and how they are produced. In our 
method, a machine translation method is applied 
to tackle golden-standard treebank, while all the 
previous works focus on the unlabeled data.
Although cross-language technique has been 
used in other natural language processing tasks, 
it is basically new for syntactic parsing as few 
works were concerned with this issue. The rea-
son is straightforward, syntactic structure is too 
complicated to be properly translated and the cost 
of translation cannot be afforded in many cases. 
However, we empirically find this difficulty may 
be dramatically alleviated as dependencies rather 
than phrases are used for syntactic structure repre-
sentation. Even the translation outputs are not so 
good as the expected, a dependency parser for the 
target language can effectively make use of them 
by only considering the most related information 
extracted from the translated text.
The basic idea to support this work is to make 
use of the semantic connection between different 
languages. In this sense, it is related to the work of 
(Merlo et al., 2002) and (Burkett and Klein, 2008). 
The former showed that complementary informa-
tion about English verbs can be extracted from 
their translations in a second language (Chinese) 
and the use of multilingual features improves clas-
sification performance of the English verbs. The 
latter iteratively trained a model to maximize the 
marginal likelihood of tree pairs, with alignments 
treated as latent variables, and then jointly parsing 
bilingual sentences in a translation pair. The pro-
posed parser using features from monolingual and 
mutual constraints helped its log-linear model to 
achieve better performance for both monolingual 
parsers and machine translation system. In this 
work, cross-language features will be also adopted 
as the latter work. However, although it is not es-
sentially different, we only focus on dependency 
parsing itself, while the parsing scheme in (Bur-
kett and Klein, 2008) based on a constituent rep-
resentation.
Among of existing works that we are aware of, 
we regard that the most similar one to ours is (Ze-
man and Resnik, 2008), who adapted a parser to a 
new language that is much poorer in linguistic re-
sources than the source language. However, there 
are two main differences between their work and 
ours. The first is that they considered a pair of suf-
ficiently related languages, Danish and Swedish, 
and made full use of the similar characteristics of 
two languages. Here we consider two quite dif-
ferent languages, English and Chinese. As fewer 
language properties are concerned, our approach 
holds the more possibility to be extended to other 
language pairs than theirs. The second is that a 
parallel corpus is required for their work and a 
strict statistical machine translation procedure was 
performed, while our approach holds a merit of 
simplicity as only a bilingual lexicon is required.
3 Treebank Translation and Dependency 
Transformation
3.1 Data
As a case study, this work will be conducted be-
tween the source language, English, and the tar-
get language, Chinese, namely, we will investigate
56
how a translated English treebank enhances a Chi-
nese dependency parser.
For English data, the Penn Treebank (PTB) 3 
is used. The constituency structures is converted 
to dependency trees by using the same rules as 
(Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) and the standard 
training/development/test split is used. However, 
only training corpus (sections 2-21) is used for 
this study. For Chinese data, the Chinese Treebank 
(CTB) version 4.0 is used in our experiments. The 
same rules for conversion and the same data split 
is adopted as (Wang et al., 2007): files 1-270 and 
400-931 as training, 271-300 as testing and files 
301-325 as development. We use the gold stan-
dard segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tags 
in both treebanks.
As a bilingual lexicon is required for our task 
and none of existing lexicons are suitable for trans-
lating PTB, two lexicons, LDC Chinese-English 
Translation Lexicon Version 2.0 (LDC2002L27), 
and an English to Chinese lexicon in StarDict2, 
are conflated, with some necessary manual exten-
sions, to cover 99% words appearing in the PTB 
(the most part of the untranslated words are named 
entities.). This lexicon includes 123K entries.
3.2 Translation
A word-by-word statistical machine translation 
strategy is adopted to translate words attached 
with the respective dependency information from 
the source language to the target one. In detail, a 
word-based decoding is used, which adopts a log- 
linear framework as in (Och and Ney, 2002) with 
only two features, translation model and language 
model,
exp[E2i� 1 Aihi(c, e)] 
E, exp[E2i� 1 Aihi(c, e)]
Where
h1 (c, e) = log(p .y(c�e))
is the translation model, which is converted from 
the bilingual lexicon, and
h2 (c, e) = log (pO (c))
is the language model, a word trigram model 
trained from the CTB. In our experiment, we set
two weights A1 = A2 = 1.
2StarDict is an open source dictionary software, available 
at http://stardict.sourceforge.net/.
The conversion process of the source treebank 
is completed by three steps as the following:
1. Bind POS tag and dependency relation of a 
word with itself;
2. Translate the PTB text into Chinese word by 
word. Since we use a lexicon rather than a parallel 
corpus to estimate the translation probabilities, we 
simply assign uniform probabilities to all transla-
tion options. Thus the decoding process is actu-
ally only determined by the language model. Sim-
ilar to the “bag translation” experiment in (Brown 
et al., 1990), the candidate target sentences made 
up by a sequence of the optional target words are 
ranked by the trigram language model. The output 
sentence will be generated only if it is with maxi-
mum probability as follows,
c = argmax{pO(c)p.y(c�e)} 
= argmax pO (c)
= argmaxn pO (w,)
A beam search algorithm is used for this process 
to find the best path from all the translation op-
tions; As the training stage, especially, the most 
time-consuming alignment sub-stage, is skipped, 
the translation only includes a decoding procedure 
that takes about 4.5 hours for about one million 
words of the PTB in a 2.8GHz PC.
3. After the target sentence is generated, the at-
tached POS tags and dependency information of 
each English word will also be transferred to each 
corresponding Chinese word. As word order is of-
ten changed after translation, the pointer of each 
dependency relationship, represented by a serial 
number, should be re-calculated.
Although we try to perform an exact word-by-
word translation, this aim cannot be fully reached 
in fact, as the following case is frequently encoun-
tered, multiple English words have to be translated 
into one Chinese word. To solve this problem, 
we use a policy that lets the output Chinese word 
only inherits the attached information of the high-
est syntactic head in the original multiple English 
words.
4 Dependency Parsing: Baseline 
4.1 Learning Model and Features
According to (McDonald and Nivre, 2007), all 
data-driven models for dependency parsing that 
have been proposed in recent years can be de-
scribed as either graph-based or transition-based.
P(cle) =
57
Table 1: Feature Notations
Although the former will be also used as compari-
son, the latter is chosen as the main parsing frame-
work by this study for the sake of efficiency. In de-
tail, a shift-reduce method is adopted as in (Nivre, 
2003), where a classifier is used to make a parsing 
decision step by step. In each step, the classifier 
checks a word pair, namely, s, the top of a stack 
that consists of the processed words, and, i, the 
first word in the (input) unprocessed sequence, to 
determine if a dependent relation should be estab-
lished between them. Besides two dependency arc 
building actions, a shift action and a reduce ac-
tion are also defined to maintain the stack and the 
unprocessed sequence. In this work, we adopt a 
left-to-right arc-eager parsing model, that means 
that the parser scans the input sequence from left 
to right and right dependents are attached to their 
heads as soon as possible (Hall et al., 2007).
While memory-based and margin-based learn-
ing approaches such as support vector machines 
are popularly applied to shift-reduce parsing, we 
apply maximum entropy model as the learning 
model for efficient training and adopting over-
lapped features as our work in (Zhao and Kit, 
2008), especially, those character-level ones for 
Chinese parsing. Our implementation of maxi-
mum entropy adopts L-BFGS algorithm for pa-
rameter optimization as usual.
With notations defined in Table 1, a feature set 
as shown in Table 2 is adopted. Here, we explain 
some terms in Tables 1 and 2. We used a large 
scale feature selection approach as in (Zhao et al., 
2009) to obtain the feature set in Table 2. Some 
feature notations in this paper are also borrowed 
from that work.
The feature curroot returns the root of a par-
tial parsing tree that includes a specified node. 
The feature charseq returns a character sequence 
whose members are collected from all identified 
children for a specified word.
In Table 2, as for concatenating multiple sub- 
strings into a feature string, there are two ways, 
seq and bag. The former is to concatenate all sub- 
strings without do something special. The latter 
will remove all duplicated substrings, sort the rest 
and concatenate all at last.
Note that we systemically use a group of 
character-level features. Surprisingly, as to our 
best knowledge, this is the first report on using this 
type of features in Chinese dependency parsing. 
Although (McDonald et al., 2005) used the pre-
fix of each word form instead of word form itself 
as features, character-level features here for Chi-
nese is essentially different from that. As Chinese 
is basically a character-based written language. 
Character plays an important role in many means, 
most characters can be formed as single-character 
words, and Chinese itself is character-order free 
rather than word-order free to some extent. In ad-
dition, there is often a close connection between 
the meaning of a Chinese word and its first or last 
character.
4.2 Parsing using a Beam Search Algorithm
In Table 2, the feature preact� returns the previous 
parsing action type, and the subscript n stands for 
the action order before the current action. These 
are a group of Markovian features. Without this 
type of features, a shift-reduce parser may directly 
scan through an input sequence in linear time. 
Otherwise, following the work of (Duan et al., 
2007) and (Zhao, 2009), the parsing algorithm is 
to search a parsing action sequence with the max-
imal probability.
Y5di = argmax p(di �di-1di-2...)�
i
where 5di is the object parsing action sequence,
p(di � di-1...) is the conditional probability, and di

5 Exploiting the Translated Treebank
As we cannot expect too much for a word-by-word 
translation, only word pairs with dependency rela-
tion in translated text are extracted as useful and 
reliable information. Then some features based 
on a query in these word pairs according to the 
current parsing state (namely, words in the cur-
rent stack and input) will be derived to enhance 
the Chinese parser.
A translation sample can be seen in Figure 1. 
Although most words are satisfactorily translated, 
to generate effective features, what we still have to 
consider at first is the inconsistence between the 
translated text and the target text.
In Chinese, word lemma is always its word form 
itself, this is a convenient characteristic in com-
putational linguistics and makes lemma features 
unnecessary for Chinese parsing at all. However, 
Chinese has a special primary processing task, i.e., 
word segmentation. Unfortunately, word defini-
tions for Chinese are not consistent in various lin-
guistical views, for example, seven segmentation 
conventions for computational purpose are for-
mally proposed since the first Bakeoff3.
Note that CTB or any other Chinese treebank 
has its own word segmentation guideline. Chi-
nese word should be strictly segmented according 
to the guideline before POS tags and dependency 
relations are annotated. However, as we say the
3Bakeoff is a Chinese processing share task held by 
SIGHAN.
59
English treebank is translated into Chinese word 
by word, Chinese words in the translated text are 
exactly some entries from the bilingual lexicon, 
they are actually irregular phrases, short sentences 
or something else rather than words that follows 
any existing word segmentation convention. If the 
bilingual lexicon is not carefully selected or re-
fined according to the treebank where the Chinese 
parser is trained from, then there will be a serious 
inconsistence on word segmentation conventions 
between the translated and the target treebanks.
As all concerned feature values here are calcu-
lated from the searching result in the translated 
word pair list according to the current parsing 
state, and a complete and exact match cannot be 
always expected, our solution to the above seg-
mentation issue is using a partial matching strat-
egy based on characters that the words include.
Above all, a translated word pair list, L, is ex-
tracted from the translated treebank. Each item in 
the list consists of three elements, dependant word 
(dp), head word (hd) and the frequency of this pair 
in the translated treebank, f .
There are two basic strategies to organize the 
features derived from the translated word pair list. 
The first is to find the most matching word pair 
in the list and extract some properties from it, 
such as the matched length, part-of-speech tags 
and so on, to generate features. Note that a 
matching priority serial should be defined afore- 
hand in this case. The second is to check every 
matching models between the current parsing state 
and the partially matched word pair. In an early 
version of our approach, the former was imple-
mented. However, It is proven to be quite inef-
ficient in computation. Thus we adopt the sec-
ond strategy at last. Two matching model fea-
ture functions, 0(•) and 0(•), are correspondingly
defined as follows. The return value of 0(•) or 
0(•) is the logarithmic frequency of the matched 
item. There are four input parameters required
by the function 0(•). Two parameters of them
are about which part of the stack(input) words is 
chosen, and other two are about which part of 
each item in the translated word pair is chosen. 
These parameters could be set to full or charn as 
shown in Table 1, where n = ..., —2, —1, 1, 2, .... 
For example, a possible feature could be
�(s. f ull, i.chari, dp. f ull, hd.char1 ), it tries to
find a match in L by comparing stack word and 
dp word, and the first character of input word
Table 3: Features based on the translated treebank
and the first character of hd word. If such 
a match item in L is found, then 0(•) returns
log(f ). There are three input parameters required 
by the function 0(•). One parameter is about
which part of the stack(input) words is chosen, 
and the other is about which part of each item 
in the translated word pair is chosen. The third 
is about the matching type that may be set to 
dependant, head, or root. For example, the 
function 0(i.chari, hd. f ull, root) tries to find a 
match in L by comparing the first character of in-
put word and the whole dp word. If such a match 
item in L is found, then �(•) returns log(f) as hd 
occurs as ROOT f times.
As having observed that CTB and PTB share a 
similar POS guideline. A POS pair list from PTB 
is also extract. Two types of features, rootscore 
and pairscore are used to make use of such infor-
mation. Both of them returns the logarithmic value 
of the frequency for a given dependent event. The 
difference is, rootscore counts for the given POS 
tag occurring as ROOT, and pairscore counts for 
two POS tag combination occurring for a depen-
dent relationship.
A full adapted feature list that is derived from 
the translated word pairs is in Table 3.
6 Evaluation Results
The quality of the parser is measured by the pars-
ing accuracy or the unlabeled attachment score 
(UAS), i.e., the percentage of tokens with correct 
head. Two types of scores are reported for compar-
ison: “UAS without p” is the UAS score without 
all punctuation tokens and “UAS with p” is the one 
with all punctuation tokens.
The results with different feature sets are in Ta-
ble 4. As the features preactn are involved, a

mance improvement as high as 1.3%.

Figure 2: Performance vs. dependency length
To compare our parser to the state-of-the-art 
counterparts, we use the same testing data as 
(Wang et al., 2005) did, selecting the sentences 
length up to 40. Table 5 shows the results achieved 
by other researchers and ours (UAS with p), which 
indicates that our parser outperforms any other 
ones 4. However, our results is only slightly better 
than that of (Chen et al., 2008) as only sentences 
whose lengths are less than 40 are considered. As 
our full result is much better than the latter, this 
comparison indicates that our approach improves 
the performance for those longer sentences.

°This results was reported in (Wang et al., 2007).
The experimental results in (McDonald and 
Nivre, 2007) show a negative impact on the pars-
ing accuracy from too long dependency relation. 
For the proposed method, the improvement rela-
tive to dependency length is shown in Figure 2. 
From the figure, it is seen that our method gives 
observable better performance when dependency 
lengths are larger than 4. Although word order is 
changed, the results here show that the useful in-
formation from the translated treebank still help 
those long distance dependencies.
4There is a slight exception: using the same data splitting,

7 Discussion
If a treebank in the source language can help im-
prove parsing in the target language, then there 
must be something common between these two 
languages, or more precisely, these two corre-
sponding treebanks. (Zeman and Resnik, 2008) 
assumed that the morphology and syntax in the 
language pair should be very similar, and that is 
so for the language pair that they considered, Dan-
ish and Swedish, two very close north European 
languages. Thus it is somewhat surprising that 
we show a translated English treebank may help 
Chinese parsing, as English and Chinese even be-
long to two different language systems. However, 
it will not be so strange if we recognize that PTB 
and CTB share very similar guidelines on POS and 
syntactics annotation. Since it will be too abstract 
in discussing the details of the annotation guide-
lines, we look into the similarities of two treebanks 
from the matching degree of two word pair lists. 
The reason is that the effectiveness of the proposed 
method actually relies on how many word pairs at 
every parsing states can find their full or partial 
matched partners in the translated word pair list. 
Table 6 shows such a statistics on the matching 
degree distribution from all training samples for 
Chinese parsing. The statistics in the table suggest 
that most to-be-check word pairs during parsing 
have a full or partial hitting in the translated word 
pair list. The latter then obtains an opportunity to 
provide a great deal of useful guideline informa-
tion to help determine how the former should be 
tackled. Therefore we have cause for attributing 
the effectiveness of the proposed method to the 
similarity of these two treebanks. From Table 6,
61
we also find that the partial matching strategy de-
fined in Section 5 plays a very important role in 
improving the whole matching degree. Note that 
our approach is not too related to the characteris-
tics of two languages. Our discussion here brings 
an interesting issue, which difference is more im-
portant in cross language processing, between two 
languages themselves or the corresponding anno-
tated corpora? This may be extensively discussed 
in the future work.

None	Partial	16.2
None	Full	9.9
Partial	None	12.4
Partial	Partial	42.6

Full	None	3.7

Full	Full	0.2
Note that only a bilingual lexicon is adopted in 
our approach. We regard it one of the most mer-
its for our approach. A lexicon is much easier to 
be obtained than an annotated corpus. One of the 
remained question about this work is if the bilin-
gual lexicon should be very specific for this kind 
of tasks. According to our experiences, actually, it 
is not so sensitive to choose a highly refined lexi-
con or not. We once found many words, mostly 
named entities, were outside the lexicon. Thus 
we managed to collect a named entity translation 
dictionary to enhance the original one. However, 
this extra effort did not receive an observable per-
formance improvement in return. Finally we re-
alize that a lexicon that can guarantee two word 
pair lists highly matched is sufficient for this work, 
and this requirement may be conveniently satis-
fied only if the lexicon consists of adequate high- 
frequent words from the source treebank.
8 Conclusion and Future Work
We propose a method to enhance dependency 
parsing in one language by using a translated tree- 
bank from another language. A simple statisti-
cal machine translation technique, word-by-word 
decoding, where only a bilingual lexicon is nec-
essary, is used to translate the source treebank. 
As dependency parsing is concerned with the re-
lations of word pairs, only those word pairs with 
dependency relations in the translated treebank are
chosen to generate some additional features to en-
hance the parser for the target language. The ex-
perimental results in English and Chinese tree- 
banks show the proposed method is effective and 
helps the Chinese parser in this work achieve a 
state-of-the-art result.
Note that our method is evaluated in two tree- 
banks with a similar annotation style and it avoids 
using too many linguistic properties. Thus the 
method is in the hope of being used in other simi-
larly annotated treebanks 5. For an immediate ex-
ample, we may adopt a translated Chinese tree- 
bank to improve English parsing. Although there 
are still something to do, the remained key work 
has been as simple as considering how to deter-
mine the matching strategy for searching the trans-
lated word pair list in English according to the 
framework of our method. .
