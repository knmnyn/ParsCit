Abstract
A number of studies have presented 
machine-learning approaches to semantic 
role labeling with availability of corpora 
such as FrameNet and PropBank. These 
corpora define the semantic roles of predi-
cates for each frame independently. Thus, 
it is crucial for the machine-learning ap-
proach to generalize semantic roles across 
different frames, and to increase the size 
of training instances. This paper ex-
plores several criteria for generalizing se-
mantic roles in FrameNet: role hierar-
chy, human-understandable descriptors of 
roles, semantic types of filler phrases, and 
mappings from FrameNet roles to the-
matic roles of VerbNet. We also pro-
pose feature functions that naturally com-
bine and weight these criteria, based on 
the training data. The experimental result 
of the role classification shows 19.16% 
and 7.42% improvements in error reduc-
tion rate and macro-averaged F 1 score, re-
spectively. We also provide in-depth anal-
yses of the proposed criteria.
1 Introduction
Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a task of analyz-
ing predicate-argument structures in texts. More 
specifically, SRL identifies predicates and their 
arguments with appropriate semantic roles. Re-
solving surface divergence of texts (e.g., voice 
of verbs and nominalizations) into unified seman-
tic representations, SRL has attracted much at-
tention from researchers into various NLP appli-
cations including question answering (Narayanan 
and Harabagiu, 2004; Shen and Lapata, 2007;

tion (Surdeanu et al., 2003).
In recent years, with the wide availability of cor-
pora such as PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and 
FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), a number of stud-
ies have presented statistical approaches to SRL 
(M`arquez et al., 2008). Figure 1 shows an exam-
ple of the frame definitions for a verb buy in Prop- 
Bank and FrameNet. These corpora define a large 
number of frames and define the semantic roles for 
each frame independently. This fact is problem-
atic in terms of the performance of the machine- 
learning approach, because these definitions pro-
duce many roles that have few training instances.
PropBank defines a frame for each sense of 
predicates (e.g., buy.01), and semantic roles are 
defined in a frame-specific manner (e.g., buyer and 
seller for buy.01). In addition, these roles are asso-
ciated with tags such as ARG0-5 and AM-*, which 
are commonly used in different frames. Most 
SRL studies on PropBank have used these tags 
in order to gather a sufficient amount of training 
data, and to generalize semantic-role classifiers 
across different frames. However, Yi et al. (2007) 
reported that tags ARG2 –ARG5 were inconsis-
tent and not that suitable as training instances. 
Some recent studies have addressed alternative ap-
proaches to generalizing semantic roles across dif-
ferent frames (Gordon and Swanson, 2007; Zapi-

FrameNet designs semantic roles as frame spe-
cific, but also defines hierarchical relations of se-
mantic roles among frames. Figure 2 illustrates 
an excerpt of the role hierarchy in FrameNet; this 
figure indicates that the Buyer role for the Com-
merce buy frame (Commerce buy::Buyer here-
after) and the Commerce sell::Buyer role are in-
herited from the Transfer:: Recipient role. Al-
though the role hierarchy was expected to gener-
alize semantic roles, no positive results for role 
classification have been reported (Baldewein et al., 
2004). Therefore, the generalization of semantic 
roles across different frames has been brought up 
as a critical issue for FrameNet (Gildea and Juraf-
sky, 2002; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005; Giuglea and 
Moschitti, 2006)
In this paper, we explore several criteria for gen-
eralizing semantic roles in FrameNet. In addi-
tion to the FrameNet hierarchy, we use various 
pieces of information: human-understandable de-
scriptors of roles, semantic types of filler phrases, 
and mappings from FrameNet roles to the thematic 
roles of VerbNet. We also propose feature func-
tions that naturally combines these criteria in a 
machine-learning framework. Using the proposed 
method, the experimental result of the role classi-
fication shows 19.16% and 7.42% improvements 
in error reduction rate and macro-averaged F1, re-
spectively. We provide in-depth analyses with re-
spect to these criteria, and state our conclusions.
2 Related Work
Moschitti et al. (2005) first classified roles by us-
ing four coarse-grained classes (Core Roles, Ad-
juncts, Continuation Arguments and Co-referring 
Arguments), and built a classifier for each coarse- 
grained class to tag PropBank ARG tags. Even 
though the initial classifiers could perform rough 
estimations of semantic roles, this step was not 
able to solve the ambiguity problem in PropBank 
ARG2-5. When training a classifier for a seman-
tic role, Baldewein et al. (2004) re-used the train-
ing instances of other roles that were similar to the 
target role. As similarity measures, they used the 
FrameNet hierarchy, peripheral roles of FrameNet, 
and clusters constructed by a EM-based method. 
Gordon and Swanson (2007) proposed a general-
ization method for the PropBank roles based on 
syntactic similarity in frames.
Many previous studies assumed that thematic 
roles bridged semantic roles in different frames. 
Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) showed that classifica-
tion accuracy was improved by manually replac-
ing FrameNet roles into 18 thematic roles. Shi 
and Mihalcea (2005) and Giuglea and Moschitti 
(2006) employed VerbNet thematic roles as the 
target of mappings from the roles defined by the 
different semantic corpora. Using the thematic 
roles as alternatives of ARG tags, Loper et al. 
(2007) and Yi et al. (2007) demonstrated that the 
classification accuracy of PropBank roles was im-
proved for ARG2 roles, but that it was diminished 
for ARG1. Yi et al. (2007) also described that 
ARG2–5 were mapped to a variety of thematic 
roles. Zapirain et al. (2008) evaluated PropBank 
ARG tags and VerbNet thematic roles in a state-of- 
the-art SRL system, and concluded that PropBank 
ARG tags achieved a more robust generalization of 
the roles than did VerbNet thematic roles.
3 Role Classification
SRL is a complex task wherein several problems 
are intertwined: frame-evoking word identifica-
tion, frame disambiguation (selecting a correct 
frame from candidates for the evoking word), role- 
phrase identification (identifying phrases that fill 
semantic roles), and role classification (assigning 
correct roles to the phrases). In this paper, we fo-
cus on role classification, in which the role gen-
eralization is particularly critical to the machine 
learning approach.
In the role classification task, we are given a 
sentence, a frame evoking word, a frame, and

ested in choosing the correct role from the can-
didate roles for each phrase in the frame. Figure 3

role at a node in the hierarchy inherits the char-
acteristics of the roles of its ancestor nodes. For 
example, Commerce sell::Seller in Figure 2 in-
herits the property of Giving:: Donor.
For Inheritance, Using, Perspective on, and 
Subframe relations, we assume that descendant 
roles in these relations have the same or special-
ized properties of their ancestors. Hence, for each 
role yi, we define the following two role groups,
Hchild	= {y y = yi V y is a child of yi},
yi	= {yly = yi V y is a descendant of yij.
Hdesc	
yi	
The hierarchical-relation groups in Figure 4 are 
the illustrations of Hdesc
yi	.
For the relation types Inchoative of and 
Causative of, we define role groups in the oppo-
site direction of the hierarchy,

	yi	= {yjy = yi V y is anancestor of yij.

We formalize the generalization of semantic roles 
as the act of grouping several roles into a 
class. We define a role group as a set of 
role labels grouped by a criterion. Figure 4 
shows examples of role groups; a group Giv-
ing::Donor (in the hierarchical-relation groups) 
contains the roles Giving::Donor and Com-
merce pay::Buyer. The remainder of this section 
describes the grouping criteria in detail.
4.1 Hierarchical relations among roles
FrameNet defines hierarchical relations among 
frames (frame-to-frame relations). Each relation 
is assigned one of the seven types of directional 
relationships (Inheritance, Using, Perspective on, 
Causative of, Inchoative of, Subframe, and Pre-
cedes). Some roles in two related frames are also 
connected with role-to-role relations. We assume 
that this hierarchy is a promising resource for gen-
eralizing the semantic roles; the idea is that the
This is because lower roles of Inchoative of 
and Causative of relations represent more neu-
tral stances or consequential states; for example, 
Killing::Victim is a parent of Death:: Protagonist 
in the Causative of relation.
Finally, the Precedes relation describes the se-
quence of states and events, but does not spec-
ify the direction of semantic inclusion relations.
Therefore, we simply try Hchild Hdesc Hparent
yi , yi,yi ,
and Hynce for this relation type.
4.2 Human-understandable role descriptor 
FrameNet defines each role as frame-specific; in 
other words, the same identifier does not appear 
in different frames. However, in FrameNet, 
human experts assign a human-understandable 
name to each role in a rather systematic man-
ner. Some names are shared by the roles in 
different frames, whose identifiers are dif-
ferent. Therefore, we examine the semantic
21
commonality of these names; we construct an 
equivalence class of the roles sharing the same 
name. We call these human-understandable 
names role descriptors. In Figure 4, the role- 
descriptor group Buyer collects the roles Com-
merce pay::Buyer, Commerce buy::Buyer, 
and Commerce sell::Buyer.
This criterion may be effective in collecting 
similar roles since the descriptors have been anno-
tated by intuition of human experts. As illustrated 
in Figure 2, the role descriptors group the seman-
tic roles which are similar to the roles that the 
FrameNet hierarchy connects as sister or parent- 
child relations. However, role-descriptor groups 
cannot express the relations between the roles 
as inclusions since they are equivalence classes. 
For example, the roles Commerce sell::Buyer 
and Commerce buy::Buyer are included in the 
role descriptor group Buyer in Figure 2; how-
ever, it is difficult to merge Giving:: Recipient 
and Commerce sell::Buyer because the Com-
merce sell:: Buyer has the extra property that one 
gives something of value in exchange and a hu-
man assigns different descriptors to them. We ex-
pect that the most effective weighting of these two 
criteria will be determined from the training data.
4.3 Semantic type of phrases
We consider that the selectional restriction is help-
ful in detecting the semantic roles. FrameNet pro-
vides information concerning the semantic types 
of role phrases (fillers); phrases that play spe-
cific roles in a sentence should fulfill the se-
mantic constraint from this information. For 
instance, FrameNet specifies the constraint that 
Self motion::Area should be filled by phrases 
whose semantic type is Location. Since these 
types suggest a coarse-grained categorization of 
semantic roles, we construct role groups that con-
tain roles whose semantic types are identical.
4.4 Thematic roles of VerbNet
VerbNet thematic roles are 23 frame-independent 
semantic categories for arguments of verbs, 
such as Agent, Patient, Theme and Source. 
These categories have been used as consis-
tent labels across verbs. We use a partial 
mapping between FrameNet roles and Verb- 
Net thematic roles provided by SemLink. 1 
Each group is constructed as a set Tti =
1http://verbs.colorado.edu/semlink/ 
{yISemLink maps y into the thematic role ti}.
SemLink currently maps 1,726 FrameNet roles 
into VerbNet thematic roles, which are 37.61% of 
roles appearing at least once in the FrameNet cor-
pus. This may diminish the effect of thematic-role 
groups than its potential.
5 Role classification method 
5.1 Traditional approach
We are given a frame-evoking word e, a frame f 
and a role phrase x detected by a human or some 
automatic process in a sentence s. Let Yf be the 
set of semantic roles that FrameNet defines as be-
ing possible role assignments for the frame f, and 
let x = {x1, ... , x,,,} be observed features for x 
from s, e and f . The task of semantic role classifi-
cation can be formalized as the problem of choos-
ing the most suitable role y� from Yf. Suppose we 
have a model P(yIf, x) which yields the condi-
tional probability of the semantic role y for given 
f and x. Then we can choose y� as follows:
y� = argmax P(y� f, x).	(1)
yEYf
A traditional way to incorporate role groups 
into this formalization is to overwrite each role 
y in the training and test data with its role 
group m(y) according to the memberships of 
the group. For example, semantic roles Com-
merce sell::Seller and Giving::Donor can be re-
placed by their thematic-role group Theme::Agent 
in this approach. We determine the most suitable 
role group c� as follows:
c� = argmax P-(c�f, x).	(2)
cE �-(y)�yEYf}
Here, P-(c�f, x) presents the probability of the 
role group c for f and x. The role y� is determined 
uniquely iff a single role y E Yf is associated 
with �c. Some previous studies have employed this 
idea to remedy the data sparseness problem in the 
training data (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). How-
ever, we cannot apply this approach when multi-
ple roles in Yf are contained in the same class. For 
example, we can construct a semantic-type group 
St::State of affairs in which Giving::Reason and 
Giving:: Means are included, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 4. If c� = St:: State of affairs, we cannot dis-
ambiguate which original role is correct. In ad-
dition, it may be more effective to use various
22
groupings of roles together in the model. For in-
stance, the model could predict the correct role 
Commerce sell::Seller for the phrase “you” in 
Figure 3 more confidently, if it could infer its 
thematic-role group as Theme::Agent and its par-
ent group Giving::Donor correctly. Although the 
ensemble of various groupings seems promising, 
we need an additional procedure to prioritize the 
groupings for the case where the models for mul-
tiple role groupings disagree; for example, it is un-
satisfactory if two models assign the groups Giv-
ing:: Theme and Theme::Agent to the same phrase.
5.2 Role groups as feature functions
We thus propose another approach that incorpo-
rates group information as feature functions. We 
model the conditional probability P(y� f, x) by us-
ing the maximum entropy framework,
exp(Ei Aigi(x, y))
�( y� f, x) = Ey,Y, exp(Ei Aigi(x, y)). (3)
Here, G = Jgi� denotes a set of n feature func-
tions, and A = JAi� denotes a weight vector for 
the feature functions.
In general, feature functions for the maximum 
entropy model are designed as indicator functions 
for possible pairs of xj and y. For example, the 
event where the head word of x is “you” (xi = 1) 
and x plays the role Commerce sell::Seller in a 
sentence is expressed by the indicator function,
1 (xi =1A
y = Commerce sell::Seller)
0 (otherwise)
(4)
We call this kind of feature function an x-role.
In order to incorporate role groups into the 
model, we also include all feature functions for 
possible pairs of xj and role groups. Equation 5 
is an example of a feature function for instances 
where the head word of x is “you” and y is in the 
role group Theme::Agent,
1 (xi=1A
y E Theme::Agent) . (5) 
0 (otherwise)
Thus, this feature function fires for the roles wher-
ever the head word “you” plays Agent (e.g., Com-
merce sell::Seller, Commerce buy::Buyer and 
Giving:: Donor). We call this kind of feature func-
tion an x-group function.
In this way, we obtain x-group functions for 
all grouping methods, e.g., gtheme
k, ghierarchy
k . 
The role-group features will receive more training 
instances by collecting instances for fine-grained 
roles. Thus, semantic roles with few training in-
stances are expected to receive additional clues 
from other training instances via role-group fea-
tures. Another advantage of this approach is that 
the usefulness of the different role groups is de-
termined by the training processes in terms of 
weights of feature functions. Thus, we do not need 
to assume that we have found the best criterion for 
grouping roles; we can allow a training process to 
choose the criterion. We will discuss the contribu-
tions of different groupings in the experiments. 
5.3 Comparison with related work
Baldewein et al. (2004) suggested an approach 
that uses role descriptors and hierarchical rela-
tions as criteria for generalizing semantic roles 
in FrameNet. They created a classifier for each 
frame, additionally using training instances for the 
role A to train the classifier for the role B, if the 
roles A and B were judged as similar by a crite-
rion. This approach performs similarly to the over-
writing approach, and it may obscure the differ-
ences among roles. Therefore, they only re-used 
the descriptors as a similarity measure for the roles 
whose coreness was peripheral. 2
In contrast, we use all kinds of role descriptors 
to construct groups. Since we use the feature func-
tions for both the original roles and their groups, 
appropriate units for classification are determined 
automatically in the training process.
6 Experiment and Discussion
We used the training set of the Semeval-2007 
Shared task (Baker et al., 2007) in order to ascer-
tain the contributions of role groups. This dataset 
consists of the corpus of FrameNet release 1.3 
(containing roughly 150,000 annotations), and an 
additional full-text annotation dataset. We ran-
domly extracted 10% of the dataset for testing, and 
used the remainder (90%) for training.
Performance was measured by micro- and 
macro-averaged F 1(Chang and Zheng, 2008) with 
respect to a variety of roles. The micro average bi-
ases each F1 score by the frequencies of the roles,

types of coreness (core, core-unexpressed, peripheral, extra- 
thematic) It represents the conceptual necessity of the roles 
in the frame to which it belongs.

23
and the average is equal to the classification accu-
racy when we calculate it with all of the roles in 
the test set. In contrast, the macro average does 
not bias the scores, thus the roles having a small 
number of instances affect the average more than 
the micro average.
6.1 Experimental settings
We constructed a baseline classifier that uses 
only the x-role features. The feature de-
sign is similar to that of the previous stud-
ies (M`arquez et al., 2008). The characteristics 
of x are: frame, frame evoking word, head 
word, content word (Surdeanu et al., 2003), 
first/last word, head word of left/right sister, 
phrase type, position, voice, syntactic path (di-
rected/undirected/partial), governing category 
(Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), WordNet super- 
sense in the phrase, combination features of 
frame evoking word & headword, combination 
features of frame evoking word & phrase type, 
and combination features of voice & phrase type. 
We also used PoS tags and stem forms as extra 
features of any word-features.
We employed Charniak and Johnson’s rerank-
ing parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) to an-
alyze syntactic trees. As an alternative for the 
traditional named-entity features, we used Word- 
Net supersenses: 41 coarse-grained semantic cate-
gories of words such as person, plant, state, event, 
time, location. We used Ciaramita and Altun’s Su-
per Sense Tagger (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006) to 
tag the supersenses. The baseline system achieved 
89.00% with respect to the micro-averaged F1.
The x-group features were instantiated similarly 
to the x-role features; the x-group features com-
bined the characteristics of x with the role groups 
presented in this paper. The total number of fea-
tures generated for all x-roles and x-groups was 
74,873,602. The optimal weights A of the fea-
tures were obtained by the maximum a poste-
rior (MAP) estimation. We maximized an L2- 
regularized log-likelihood of the training set us-
ing the Limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) method 
(Nocedal, 1980).
6.2 Effect of role groups
Table 1 shows the micro and macro averages of F 1 
scores. Each role group type improved the micro 
average by 0.5 to 1.7 points. The best result was 
obtained by using all types of groups together. The 
result indicates that different kinds of group com-

plement each other with respect to semantic role 
generalization. Baldewein et al. (2004) reported 
that hierarchical relations did not perform well for 
their method and experimental setting; however, 
we found that significant improvements could also 
be achieved with hierarchical relations. We also 
tried a traditional label-replacing approach with 
role descriptors (in the third row of Table 1). The 
comparison between the second and third rows in-
dicates that mixing the original fine-grained roles 
and the role groups does result in a more accurate 
classification.
By using all types of groups together, the 
model reduced 19.16 % of the classification errors 
from the baseline. Moreover, the macro-averaged 
F1 scores clearly showed improvements resulting 
from using role groups. In order to determine 
the reason for the improvements, we measured 
the precision, recall, and F1-scores with respect 
to roles for which the number of training instances 
was at most 10, 20, and 50. In Table 2, we show 
that the micro-averaged F1 score for roles hav-
ing 10 instances or less was improved (by 15.46 
points) when all role groups were used. This result 
suggests the reason for the effect of role groups; by 
bridging similar semantic roles, they supply roles 
having a small number of instances with the infor-
mation from other roles.
6.3 Analyses of role descriptors
In Table 1, the largest improvement was obtained 
by the use of role descriptors. We analyze the ef-
fect of role descriptors in detail in Tables 3 and 4.

semantic roles when we use role-descriptor groups 
constructed from each type of coreness (core3, pe-
ripheral, and extra-thematic) individually. The pe-
ripheral type generated the largest improvements.
Table 4 shows the number of roles associated 
with each type of coreness (#roles), the number of 
instances for the original roles (#instances/#role), 
the number of groups for each type of coreness 
(#groups), the number of instances for each group 
(#instances/#group), and the number of roles per 
each group (#roles/#group). In the peripheral 
type, the role descriptors subdivided 1,924 distinct 
roles into 250 groups, each of which contained 7.7 
roles on average. The peripheral type included 
semantic roles such as place, time, reason, dura-
tion. These semantic roles appear in many frames, 
because they have general meanings that can be 
shared by different frames. Moreover, the seman-
tic roles of peripheral type originally occurred in 
only a small number (25.24) of training instances 
on average. Thus, we infer that the peripheral 
type generated the largest improvement because 
semantic roles in this type acquired the greatest 
benefit from the generalization.
6.4 Hierarchical relations and relation types
We analyzed the contributions of the FrameNet hi-
erarchy for each type of role-to-role relations and 
for different depths of grouping. Table 5 shows 
the micro-averaged F1 scores obtained from var-
ious relation types and depths. The Inheritance 
and Using relations resulted in a slightly better ac-
curacy than the other types. We did not observe 
any real differences among the remaining five re-
lation types, possibly because there were few se-

mantic roles associated with these types. We ob-
tained better results by using not only groups for 
parent roles, but also groups for all ancestors. The 
best result was obtained by using all relations in 
the hierarchy.
6.5 Analyses of different grouping criteria
Table 6 reports the precision, recall, and micro- 
averaged F1 scores of semantic roles with respect 
to each coreness type .4 In general, semantic roles 
of the core coreness were easily identified by all 
of the grouping criteria; even the baseline system 
obtained an F 1 score of 91.93. For identifying se-
mantic roles of the peripheral and extra-thematic 
types of coreness, the simplest solution, the de-
scriptor criterion, outperformed other criteria.
In Table 7, we categorize feature functions 
whose weights are in the top 1000 in terms of 
greatest absolute value. The behaviors of the role 
groups can be distinguished by the following two 
characteristics. Groups of role descriptors and se-
mantic types have large weight values for the first 
word and supersense features, which capture the 
characteristics of adjunctive phrases. The original 
roles and hierarchical-relation groups have strong
4The figures of role descriptors in Tables 4 and 6 differ. 
In Table 4, we measured the performance when we used one 
or all types of coreness for training. In contrast, in Table 6, 
we used all types of coreness for training, but computed the 
performance of semantic roles for each coreness separately.

associations with lexical and structural character-
istics such as the syntactic path, content word, and 
head word. Table 7 suggests that role-descriptor 
groups and semantic-type groups are effective for 
peripheral or adjunctive roles, and hierarchical re-
lation groups are effective for core roles.
7 Conclusion
We have described different criteria for general-
izing semantic roles in FrameNet. They were: 
role hierarchy, human-understandable descriptors 
of roles, semantic types of filler phrases, and 
mappings from FrameNet roles to thematic roles 
of VerbNet. We also proposed a feature design 
that combines and weights these criteria using the 
training data. The experimental result of the role 
classification task showed a 19.16% of the error 
reduction and a 7.42% improvement in the macro- 
averaged F1 score. In particular, the method we 
have presented was able to classify roles having 
few instances. We confirmed that modeling the 
role generalization at feature level was better than 
the conventional approach that replaces semantic 
role labels.
Each criterion presented in this paper improved 
the accuracy of classification. The most success-
ful criterion was the use of human-understandable 
role descriptors. Unfortunately, the FrameNet hi-
erarchy did not outperform the role descriptors, 
contrary to our expectations. A future direction 
of this study would be to analyze the weakness of 
the FrameNet hierarchy in order to discuss possi-
ble improvement of the usage and annotations of

the hierarchy.
Since we used the latest release of FrameNet 
in order to use a greater number of hierarchical 
role-to-role relations, we could not make a direct 
comparison of performance with that of existing 
systems; however we may say that the 89.00% F 1 
micro-average of our baseline system is roughly 
comparable to the 88.93% value of Bejan and 
Hathaway (2007) for SemEval-2007 (Baker et al., 
2007). 5 In addition, the methodology presented in 
this paper applies generally to any SRL resources; 
we are planning to determine several grouping cri-
teria from existing linguistic resources and to ap-
ply the methodology to the PropBank corpus.
