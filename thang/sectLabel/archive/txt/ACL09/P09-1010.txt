Abstract
In this paper, we present a reinforce-
ment learning approach for mapping nat-
ural language instructions to sequences of 
executable actions. We assume access to 
a reward function that defines the qual-
ity of the executed actions. During train-
ing, the learner repeatedly constructs ac-
tion sequences for a set of documents, ex-
ecutes those actions, and observes the re-
sulting reward. We use a policy gradient 
algorithm to estimate the parameters of a 
log-linear model for action selection. We 
apply our method to interpret instructions 
in two domains — Windows troubleshoot-
ing guides and game tutorials. Our results 
demonstrate that this method can rival su-
pervised learning techniques while requir-
ing few or no annotated training exam-
ples.1
1 Introduction
The problem of interpreting instructions written 
in natural language has been widely studied since 
the early days of artificial intelligence (Winograd, 
1972; Di Eugenio, 1992). Mapping instructions to 
a sequence of executable actions would enable the 
automation of tasks that currently require human 
participation. Examples include configuring soft-
ware based on how-to guides and operating simu-
lators using instruction manuals. In this paper, we 
present a reinforcement learning framework for in-
ducing mappings from text to actions without the 
need for annotated training examples.
For concreteness, consider instructions from a 
Windows troubleshooting guide on deleting tem-
porary folders, shown in Figure 1. We aim to map

porary folder.
this text to the corresponding low-level commands 
and parameters. For example, properly interpret-
ing the third instruction requires clicking on a tab, 
finding the appropriate option in a tree control, and 
clearing its associated checkbox.
In this and many other applications, the valid-
ity of a mapping can be verified by executing the 
induced actions in the corresponding environment 
and observing their effects. For instance, in the 
example above we can assess whether the goal 
described in the instructions is achieved, i.e., the 
folder is deleted. The key idea of our approach 
is to leverage the validation process as the main 
source of supervision to guide learning. This form 
of supervision allows us to learn interpretations 
of natural language instructions when standard su-
pervised techniques are not applicable, due to the 
lack of human-created annotations.
Reinforcement learning is a natural framework 
for building models using validation from an envi-
ronment (Sutton and Barto, 1998). We assume that 
supervision is provided in the form of a reward 
function that defines the quality of executed ac-
tions. During training, the learner repeatedly con-
structs action sequences for a set of given docu-
ments, executes those actions, and observes the re-
sulting reward. The learner’s goal is to estimate a

policy — a distribution over actions given instruc-
tion text and environment state — that maximizes 
future expected reward. Our policy is modeled in a 
log-linear fashion, allowing us to incorporate fea-
tures of both the instruction text and the environ-
ment. We employ a policy gradient algorithm to 
estimate the parameters of this model.
We evaluate our method on two distinct applica-
tions: Windows troubleshooting guides and puz-
zle game tutorials. The key findings of our ex-
periments are twofold. First, models trained only 
with simple reward signals achieve surprisingly 
high results, coming within 11% of a fully su-
pervised method in the Windows domain. Sec-
ond, augmenting unlabeled documents with even 
a small fraction of annotated examples greatly re-
duces this performance gap, to within 4% in that 
domain. These results indicate the power of learn-
ing from this new form of automated supervision.
2 Related Work
Grounded Language Acquisition Our work 
fits into a broader class of approaches that aim to 
learn language from a situated context (Mooney, 
2008a; Mooney, 2008b; Fleischman and Roy, 
2005; Yu and Ballard, 2004; Siskind, 2001; Oates, 
2001). Instances of such approaches include 
work on inferring the meaning of words from 
video data (Roy and Pentland, 2002; Barnard and 
Forsyth, 2001), and interpreting the commentary 
of a simulated soccer game (Chen and Mooney, 
2008). Most of these approaches assume some 
form of parallel data, and learn perceptual co- 
occurrence patterns. In contrast, our emphasis 
is on learning language by proactively interacting 
with an external environment.
Reinforcement Learning for Language Pro-
cessing Reinforcement learning has been previ-
ously applied to the problem of dialogue manage-
ment (Scheffler and Young, 2002; Roy et al., 2000; 
Litman et al., 2000; Singh et al., 1999). These 
systems converse with a human user by taking ac-
tions that emit natural language utterances. The 
reinforcement learning state space encodes infor-
mation about the goals of the user and what they 
say at each time step. The learning problem is to 
find an optimal policy that maps states to actions, 
through a trial-and-error process of repeated inter-
action with the user.
Reinforcement learning is applied very differ-
ently in dialogue systems compared to our setup.
In some respects, our task is more easily amenable 
to reinforcement learning. For instance, we are not 
interacting with a human user, so the cost of inter-
action is lower. However, while the state space can 
be designed to be relatively small in the dialogue 
management task, our state space is determined by 
the underlying environment and is typically quite 
large. We address this complexity by developing 
a policy gradient algorithm that learns efficiently 
while exploring a small subset of the states.
3 Problem Formulation
Our task is to learn a mapping between documents 
and the sequence of actions they express. Figure 2 
shows how one example sentence is mapped to 
three actions.
Mapping Text to Actions As input, we are 
given a document d, comprising a sequence of sen-
tences (u1, ... , ut), where each ui is a sequence
of words. Our goal is to map d to a sequence of
actions a� = (a0, ... , a,1). Actions are predicted
and executed sequentially.2
An action a = (c, R, W&apos;) encompasses a com-
mand c, the command’s parameters R, and the
words W&apos; specifying c and R. Elements of R re 
fer to objects available in the environment state, as 
described below. Some parameters can also refer 
to words in document d. Additionally, to account 
for words that do not describe any actions, c can 
be a null command.
The Environment The environment state £ 
specifies the set of objects available for interac-
tion, and their properties. In Figure 2, £ is shown 
on the right. The environment state £ changes 
in response to the execution of command c with 
parameters R according to a transition distribu-
tion p(£&apos;J£, c, R). This distribution is a priori un-
known to the learner. As we will see in Section 5, 
our approach avoids having to directly estimate 
this distribution.
State To predict actions sequentially, we need to 
track the state of the document-to-actions map-
ping over time. A mapping state s is a tuple
(£, d, j, W), where £ refers to the current environ-
ment state; j is the index of the sentence currently 
being interpreted in document d; and W contains 
words that were mapped by previous actions for
2That is, action ai is executed before ai+1 is predicted.

For each step, the figure shows the words selected by the action, along with the corresponding system 
command and its parameters. The words of W&apos; are underlined, and the words of W are highlighted in 
grey.
the same sentence. The mapping state s is ob-
served after each action.
The initial mapping state s0 for document d is
(£d, d, 0, 0); £d is the unique starting environment
state for d. Performing action a in state s = 
(£, d, j, W) leads to a new state s&apos; according to
distribution p(s&apos;Is, a), defined as follows: £ tran-
sitions according to p(£&apos;I£, c, R), W is updated
with a’s selected words, and j is incremented if 
all words of the sentence have been mapped. For 
the applications we consider in this work, environ-
ment state transitions, and consequently mapping 
state transitions, are deterministic.
Training During training, we are provided with 
a set D of documents, the ability to sample from 
the transition distribution, and a reward function
r(h). Here, h = (s0, a0, ... , sn—1, an—1, sn) is
a history of states and actions visited while in-
terpreting one document. r(h) outputs a real- 
valued score that correlates with correct action 
selection.3 We consider both immediate reward, 
which is available after each action, and delayed 
reward, which does not provide feedback until the 
last action. For example, task completion is a de-
layed reward that produces a positive value after 
the final action only if the task was completed suc-
cessfully. We will also demonstrate how manu-
ally annotated action sequences can be incorpo-
rated into the reward.
3In most reinforcement learning problems, the reward
function is defined over state-action pairs, as r(s, a) — in this
case, r(h) _ Et r(st, at), and our formulation becomes a
standard finite-horizon Markov decision process. Policy gra-
dient approaches allow us to learn using the more general
case of history-based reward.
The goal of training is to estimate parameters 0
of the action selection distribution p(aI s, 0), called
the policy. Since the reward correlates with ac-
tion sequence correctness, the 0 that maximizes
expected reward will yield the best actions.
4 A Log-Linear Model for Actions
Our goal is to predict a sequence of actions. We 
construct this sequence by repeatedly choosing an 
action given the current mapping state, and apply-
ing that action to advance to a new state.
Given a state s = (£, d, j, W), the space of pos-
sible next actions is defined by enumerating sub- 
spans of unused words in the current sentence (i.e., 
subspans of the jth sentence of d not in W), and 
the possible commands and parameters in envi-
ronment state £ .4 We model the policy distribu-
tion p(aIs; 0) over this action space in a log-linear 
fashion (Della Pietra et al., 1997; Lafferty et al., 
2001), giving us the flexibility to incorporate a di-
verse range of features. Under this representation, 
the policy distribution is:
ee-�(s,a)
p(aI s; 0) = � ee-0(s,a&apos;) ,	(1)
a/
where 0(s, a) E Rn is an n-dimensional feature 
representation. During test, actions are selected 
according to the mode of this distribution.
4For parameters that refer to words, the space of possible 
values is defined by the unused words in the current sentence.
84
5 Reinforcement Learning
During training, our goal is to find the optimal pol-
icy p(aIs; 0). Since reward correlates with correct
action selection, a natural objective is to maximize 
expected future reward — that is, the reward we 
expect while acting according to that policy from 
state s. Formally, we maximize the value function:
Vo(s) = Ep(hJo) [r(h)] ,	(2)
where the history h is the sequence of states and 
actions encountered while interpreting a single 
document d E D. This expectation is averaged 
over all documents in D. The distribution p(hI0) 
returns the probability of seeing history h when 
starting from state s and acting according to a pol-
icy with parameters 0. This distribution can be de-
composed into a product over time steps:
Input: A document set D,

end
Output: Estimate of parameters 0

t=0
5.1 A Policy Gradient Algorithm
Our reinforcement learning problem is to find the 
parameters 0 that maximize Vo from equation 2. 
Although there is no closed form solution, policy 
gradient algorithms (Sutton et al., 2000) estimate 
the parameters 0 by performing stochastic gradi-
ent ascent. The gradient of Vo is approximated by 
interacting with the environment, and the resulting 
reward is used to update the estimate of 0. Policy 
gradient algorithms optimize a non-convex objec-
tive and are only guaranteed to find a local opti-
mum. However, as we will see, they scale to large 
state spaces and can perform well in practice.
To find the parameters 0 that maximize the ob-
jective, we first compute the derivative of Vo. Ex-
panding according to the product rule, we have:
a0Vo(s) = Ep(hJo) Lr(h)	�0 log p(atI st; 0) ,
t
(4)  where the inner sum is over all time steps t in 
the current history h. Expanding the inner partial 
derivative we observe that:
�a0 log p(aIs; 0) = 0(s, a)—	0(s, a&apos;)p(a&apos;Is; 0),
a/
(5)  which is the derivative of a log-linear distribution.
Equation 5 is easy to compute directly. How-
ever, the complete derivative of Vo in equation 4 
is intractable, because computing the expectation 
would require summing over all possible histo-
ries. Instead, policy gradient algorithms employ 
stochastic gradient ascent by computing a noisy 
estimate of the expectation using just a subset of 
the histories. Specifically, we draw samples from 
p(hI0) by acting in the target environment, and 
use these samples to approximate the expectation 
in equation 4. In practice, it is often sufficient to 
sample a single history h for this approximation.
Algorithm 1 details the complete policy gradi-
ent algorithm. It performs T iterations over the 
set of documents D. Step 3 samples a history that 
maps each document to actions. This is done by 
repeatedly selecting actions according to the cur-
rent policy, and updating the state by executing the 
selected actions. Steps 4 and 5 compute the empir-
ical gradient and update the parameters 0.
In many domains, interacting with the environ-
ment is expensive. Therefore, we use two tech-
niques that allow us to take maximum advantage 
of each environment interaction. First, a his-
tory h = (s0, a0, ... , sn) contains subsequences
(si, ai,... sn) for i = 1 to n — 1, each with its
own reward value given by the environment as a 
side effect of executing h. We apply the update 
from equation 5 for each subsequence. Second, 
for a sampled history h, we can propose alterna-
tive histories h&apos; that result in the same commands 
and parameters with different word spans. We can 
again apply equation 5 for each h&apos;, weighted by its 
probability under the current policy, P�h&apos;Jl1 .
85
The algorithm we have presented belongs to 
a family of policy gradient algorithms that have 
been successfully used for complex tasks such as 
robot control (Ng et al., 2003). Our formulation is 
unique in how it represents natural language in the 
reinforcement learning framework.
5.2 Reward Functions and ML Estimation
We can design a range of reward functions to guide 
learning, depending on the availability of anno-
tated data and environment feedback. Consider the 
case when every training document d E D is an-
notated with its correct sequence of actions, and 
state transitions are deterministic. Given these ex-
amples, it is straightforward to construct a reward 
function that connects policy gradient to maxi-
mum likelihood. Specifically, define a reward 
function r(h) that returns one when h matches the 
annotation for the document being analyzed, and 
zero otherwise. Policy gradient performs stochas-
tic gradient ascent on the objective from equa-
tion 2, performing one update per document. For 
document d, this objective becomes:
Ep(h�e)[r(h)] = X r(h)p(h� e) = p(hd� e),
h
where hd is the history corresponding to the an-
notated action sequence. Thus, with this reward 
policy gradient is equivalent to stochastic gradient 
ascent with a maximum likelihood objective.
At the other extreme, when annotations are 
completely unavailable, learning is still possi-
ble given informative feedback from the environ-
ment. Crucially, this feedback only needs to cor-
relate with action sequence quality. We detail 
environment-based reward functions in the next 
section. As our results will show, reward func-
tions built using this kind of feedback can provide 
strong guidance for learning. We will also con-
sider reward functions that combine annotated su-
pervision with environment feedback.
6 Applying the Model
We study two applications of our model: follow-
ing instructions to perform software tasks, and 
solving a puzzle game using tutorial guides.

form tasks and troubleshoot problems in the Win-
dows operating systems. Examples of such tasks 
include installing patches and changing security 
settings. Figure 1 shows one such article.
Our goal is to automatically execute these sup-
port articles in the Windows 2000 environment. 
Here, the environment state is the set of visi-
ble user interface (UI) objects, and object prop-
erties such as label, location, and parent window. 
Possible commands include left-click, right-click, 
double-click, and type-into, all of which take a UI 
object as a parameter; type-into additionally re-
quires a parameter for the input text.
Table 1 lists some of the features we use for this 
domain. These features capture various aspects of 
the action under consideration, the current Win-
dows UI state, and the input instructions. For ex-
ample, one lexical feature measures the similar-
ity of a word in the sentence to the UI labels of 
objects in the environment. Environment-specific 
features, such as whether an object is currently in 
focus, are useful when selecting the object to ma-
nipulate. In total, there are 4,438 features.
Reward Function Environment feedback can 
be used as a reward function in this domain. An 
obvious reward would be task completion (e.g., 
whether the stated computer problem was fixed). 
Unfortunately, verifying task completion is a chal-
lenging system issue in its own right.
Instead, we rely on a noisy method of check-
ing whether execution can proceed from one sen-
tence to the next: at least one word in each sen-
tence has to correspond to an object in the envi-
86
Figure 3: Crossblock puzzle with tutorial. For this 
level, four squares in a row or column must be re-
moved at once. The first move specified by the 
tutorial is greyed in the puzzle.
ronment.6 For instance, in the sentence from Fig-
ure 2 the word “Run” matches the Run... menu 
item. If no words in a sentence match a current 
environment object, then one of the previous sen-
tences was analyzed incorrectly. In this case, we 
assign the history a reward of -1. This reward is 
not guaranteed to penalize all incorrect histories, 
because there may be false positive matches be-
tween the sentence and the environment. When 
at least one word matches, we assign a positive 
reward that linearly increases with the percentage 
of words assigned to non-null commands, and lin-
early decreases with the number of output actions. 
This reward signal encourages analyses that inter-
pret all of the words without producing spurious 
actions.
6.2 Crossblock: A Puzzle Game
Our second application is to a puzzle game called 
Crossblock, available online as a Flash game.7 
Each of 50 puzzles is played on a grid, where some 
grid positions are filled with squares. The object 
of the game is to clear the grid by drawing vertical 
or horizontal line segments that remove groups of 
squares. Each segment must exactly cross a spe-
cific number of squares, ranging from two to seven 
depending on the puzzle. Humans players have 
found this game challenging and engaging enough 
to warrant posting textual tutorials.8 A sample 
puzzle and tutorial are shown in Figure 3.
The environment is defined by the state of the 
grid. The only command is clear, which takes a 
parameter specifying the orientation (row or col-
umn) and grid location of the line segment to be
6We assume that a word maps to an environment object if
the edit distance between the word and the object’s name is 
below a threshold value.

removed. The challenge in this domain is to seg-
ment the text into the phrases describing each ac-
tion, and then correctly identify the line segments 
from references such as “the bottom four from the 
second column from the left.”
For this domain, we use two sets of binary fea-
tures on state-action pairs (s, a). First, for each
vocabulary word w, we define a feature that is one
if w is the last word of a’s consumed words W&apos;.
These features help identify the proper text seg-
mentation points between actions. Second, we in-
troduce features for pairs of vocabulary word w 
and attributes of action a, e.g., the line orientation 
and grid locations of the squares that a would re-
move. This set of features enables us to match 
words (e.g., “row”) with objects in the environ-
ment (e.g., a move that removes a horizontal series 
of squares). In total, there are 8,094 features.
Reward Function For Crossblock it is easy to 
directly verify task completion, which we use as
the basis of our reward function. The reward r(h)
is -1 if h ends in a state where the puzzle cannot
be completed. For solved puzzles, the reward is
a positive value proportional to the percentage of
words assigned to non-null commands.
7 Experimental Setup
Datasets For the Windows domain, our dataset 
consists of 128 documents, divided into 70 for 
training, 18 for development, and 40 for test. In 
the puzzle game domain, we use 50 tutorials, 
divided into 40 for training and 10 for test.9 
Statistics for the datasets are shown below.
	Windows	Puzzle
Total # of documents	128	50
Total # of words	5562	994
Vocabulary size	610	46
Avg. words per sentence	9.93	19.88
Avg. sentences per document	4.38	1.00
Avg. actions per document	10.37	5.86
The data exhibits certain qualities that make 
for a challenging learning problem. For instance, 
there are a surprising variety of linguistic con-
structs — as Figure 4 shows, in the Windows do-
main even a simple command is expressed in at 
least six different ways.
9For Crossblock, because the number of puzzles is lim-
ited, we did not hold out a separate development set, and re-
port averaged results over five training/test splits.
87

the tools menu” present in the Windows corpus.
Experimental Framework To apply our algo-
rithm to the Windows domain, we use the Win32 
application programming interface to simulate hu-
man interactions with the user interface, and to 
gather environment state information. The operat-
ing system environment is hosted within a virtual 
machine,10 allowing us to rapidly save and reset 
system state snapshots. For the puzzle game do-
main, we replicated the game with an implemen-
tation that facilitates automatic play.
As is commonly done in reinforcement learn-
ing, we use a softmax temperature parameter to 
smooth the policy distribution (Sutton and Barto, 
1998), set to 0.1 in our experiments. For Windows, 
the development set is used to select the best pa-
rameters. For Crossblock, we choose the parame-
ters that produce the highest reward during train-
ing. During evaluation, we use these parameters 
to predict mappings for the test documents.
Evaluation Metrics For evaluation, we com-
pare the results to manually constructed sequences 
of actions. We measure the number of correct ac-
tions, sentences, and documents. An action is cor-
rect if it matches the annotations in terms of com-
mand and parameters. A sentence is correct if all 
of its actions are correctly identified, and analo-
gously for documents.11 Statistical significance is 
measured with the sign test.
Additionally, we compute a word alignment 
score to investigate the extent to which the input 
text is used to construct correct analyses. This 
score measures the percentage of words that are 
aligned to the corresponding annotated actions in 
correctly analyzed documents.
Baselines We consider the following baselines 
to characterize the performance of our approach.
10VMware Workstation, available at www.vmware.com
11In these tasks, each action depends on the correct execu-
tion of all previous actions, so a single error can render the 
remainder of that document’s mapping incorrect. In addition, 
due to variability in document lengths, overall action accu-
racy is not guaranteed to be higher than document accuracy.
•	Full Supervision Sequence prediction prob-
lems like ours are typically addressed us-
ing supervised techniques. We measure how 
a standard supervised approach would per-
form on this task by using a reward signal 
based on manual annotations of output ac-
tion sequences, as defined in Section 5.2. As 
shown there, policy gradient with this re-
ward is equivalent to stochastic gradient as-
cent with a maximum likelihood objective.
•	Partial Supervision We consider the case 
when only a subset of training documents is 
annotated, and environment reward is used 
for the remainder. Our method seamlessly 
combines these two kinds of rewards.
•	Random and Majority (Windows) We con-
sider two naive baselines. Both scan through 
each sentence from left to right. A com-
mand c is executed on the object whose name 
is encountered first in the sentence. This 
command c is either selected randomly, or 
set to the majority command, which is left- 
click. This procedure is repeated until no 
more words match environment objects.
•	Random (Puzzle) We consider a baseline 
that randomly selects among the actions that 
are valid in the current game state.12
8 Results
Table 2 presents evaluation results on the test sets. 
There are several indicators of the difficulty of this 
task. The random and majority baselines’ poor 
performance in both domains indicates that naive 
approaches are inadequate for these tasks. The 
performance of the fully supervised approach pro-
vides further evidence that the task is challenging. 
This difficulty can be attributed in part to the large 
branching factor of possible actions at each step — 
on average, there are 27.14 choices per action in 
the Windows domain, and 9.78 in the Crossblock 
domain.
In both domains, the learners relying only 
on environment reward perform well. Although 
the fully supervised approach performs the best, 
adding just a few annotated training examples 
to the environment-based learner significantly re-
duces the performance gap.
12 Since action selection is among objects, there is no natu-
ral majority baseline for the puzzle.

the proportion of correct actions, sentences, and documents. We also report the percentage of correct 
word alignments for the successfully completed documents. Note the puzzle domain has only single- 
sentence documents, so its sentence and document scores are identical. The partial supervision line 
refers to 20 out of 70 annotated training documents for Windows, and 10 out of 40 for the puzzle. Each 
result marked with * or o is a statistically significant improvement over the result immediately above it;
* indicates p &lt; 0.01 and o indicates p &lt; 0.05.
Figure 5: Comparison of two training scenarios where training is done using a subset of annotated 
documents, with and without environment reward for the remaining unannotated documents.
Figure 5 shows the overall tradeoff between an-
notation effort and system performance for the two 
domains. The ability to make this tradeoff is one 
of the advantages of our approach. The figure also 
shows that augmenting annotated documents with 
additional environment-reward documents invari-
ably improves performance.
The word alignment results from Table 2 in-
dicate that the learners are mapping the correct 
words to actions for documents that are success-
fully completed. For example, the models that per-
form best in the Windows domain achieve nearly 
perfect word alignment scores.
To further assess the contribution of the instruc-
tion text, we train a variant of our model without 
access to text features. This is possible in the game 
domain, where all of the puzzles share a single 
goal state that is independent of the instructions. 
This variant solves 34% of the puzzles, suggest-
ing that access to the instructions significantly im-
proves performance. 
9 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented a reinforcement learn-
ing approach for inducing a mapping between in-
structions and actions. This approach is able to use 
environment-based rewards, such as task comple-
tion, to learn to analyze text. We showed that hav-
ing access to a suitable reward function can signif-
icantly reduce the need for annotations.
