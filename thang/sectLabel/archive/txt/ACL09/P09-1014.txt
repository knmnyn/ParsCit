Abstract
Correct stress placement is important in 
text-to-speech systems, in terms of both 
the overall accuracy and the naturalness of 
pronunciation. In this paper, we formu-
late stress assignment as a sequence pre-
diction problem. We represent words as 
sequences of substrings, and use the sub- 
strings as features in a Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) ranker, which is trained to 
rank possible stress patterns. The rank-
ing approach facilitates inclusion of arbi-
trary features over both the input sequence 
and output stress pattern. Our system ad-
vances the current state-of-the-art, predict-
ing primary stress in English, German, and 
Dutch with up to 98% word accuracy on 
phonemes, and 96% on letters. The sys-
tem is also highly accurate in predicting 
secondary stress. Finally, when applied in 
tandem with an L2P system, it substan-
tially reduces the word error rate when 
predicting both phonemes and stress.
1 Introduction
In many languages, certain syllables in words are 
phonetically more prominent in terms of duration, 
pitch, and loudness. This phenomenon is referred 
to as lexical stress. In some languages, the loca-
tion of stress is entirely predictable. For example, 
lexical stress regularly falls on the initial syllable 
in Hungarian, and on the penultimate syllable in 
Polish. In other languages, such as English and 
Russian, any syllable in the word can be stressed.
Correct stress placement is important in text-
to-speech systems because it affects the accuracy 
of human word recognition (Tagliapietra and Ta-
bossi, 2005; Arciuli and Cupples, 2006). How-
ever, the issue has often been ignored in previ-
ous letter-to-phoneme (L2P) systems. The sys-
tems that do generate stress markers often do not 
report separate figures on stress prediction accu-
racy, or they only provide results on a single lan-
guage. Some only predict primary stress mark-
ers (Black et al., 1998; Webster, 2004; Demberg 
et al., 2007), while those that predict both primary 
and secondary stress generally achieve lower ac-
curacy (Bagshaw, 1998; Coleman, 2000; Pearson 
et al., 2000).
In this paper, we formulate stress assignment as 
a sequence prediction problem. We divide each 
word into a sequence of substrings, and use these 
substrings as features for a Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) ranker. For a given sequence length, 
there is typically only a small number of stress 
patterns in use. The task of the SVM is to rank 
the true stress pattern above the small number of 
acceptable alternatives. This is the first system 
to predict stress within a powerful discriminative 
learning framework. By using a ranking approach, 
we enable the use of arbitrary features over the en-
tire (input) sequence and (output) stress pattern. 
We show that the addition of a feature for the en-
tire output sequence improves prediction accuracy.
Our experiments on English, German, and 
Dutch demonstrate that our ranking approach sub-
stantially outperforms previous systems. The 
SVM ranker achieves exceptional 96.2% word ac-
curacy on the challenging task of predicting the 
full stress pattern in English. Moreover, when 
combining our stress predictions with a state-of- 
the-art L2P system (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008), 
we set a new standard for the combined prediction 
of phonemes and stress.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
provides background on lexical stress and a task 
definition. Section 3 presents our automatic stress 
prediction algorithm. In Section 4, we confirm the 
power of the discriminative approach with experi-
ments on three languages. Section 5 describes how 
stress is integrated into L2P conversion.

2 Background and Task Definition
There is a long history of research into the prin-
ciples governing lexical stress placement. Zipf 
(1929) showed that stressed syllables are of-
ten those with low frequency in speech, while 
unstressed syllables are usually very common. 
Chomsky and Halle (1968) proposed a set of 
context-sensitive rules for producing English 
stress from underlying word forms. Due to its 
importance in text-to-speech, there is also a long 
history of computational stress prediction sys-
tems (Fudge, 1984; Church, 1985; Williams, 
1987). While these early approaches depend 
on human definitions of vowel tensity, syllable 
weight, word etymology, etc., our work follows 
a recent trend of purely data-driven approaches to 
stress prediction (Black et al., 1998; Pearson et al., 
2000; Webster, 2004; Demberg et al., 2007).
In many languages, only two levels of stress 
are distinguished: stressed and unstressed. How-
ever, some languages exhibit more than two levels 
of stress. For example, in the English word eco-
nomic, the first and the third syllable are stressed, 
with the former receiving weaker emphasis than 
the latter. In this case, the initial syllable is said 
to carry a secondary stress. Although each word 
has only one primary stress, it may have any num-
ber of secondary stresses. Predicting the full stress 
pattern is therefore inherently more difficult than 
predicting the location of primary stress only.
Our objective is to automatically assign primary 
and, where possible, secondary stress to out-of-
vocabulary words. Stress is an attribute of sylla-
bles, but syllabification is a non-trivial task in it-
self (Bartlett et al., 2008). Rather than assuming 
correct syllabification of the input word, we in-
stead follow Webster (2004) in placing the stress 
on the vowel which constitutes the nucleus of the 
stressed syllable. If the syllable boundaries are 
known, the mapping from the vowel to the cor-
responding syllable is straightforward.
We investigate the assignment of stress to two 
related but different entities: the spoken word 
(represented by its phonetic transcription), and 
the written word (represented by its orthographic 
form). Although stress is a prosodic feature, as-
signing stress to written words (“stressed orthog-
raphy”) has been utilized as a preprocessing stage 
for the L2P task (Webster, 2004). This prepro-
cessing is motivated by two factors. First, stress 
greatly influences the pronunciation of vowels in
English (c.f., allow vs. alloy). Second, since 
phoneme predictors typically utilize only local 
context around a letter, they do not incorporate the 
global, long-range information that is especially 
predictive of stress, such as penultimate syllable 
emphasis associated with the suffix -ation. By tak-
ing stressed orthography as input, the L2P system 
is able to implicitly leverage morphological infor-
mation beyond the local context.
Indicating stress on letters can also be help-
ful to humans, especially second-language learn-
ers. In some languages, such as Spanish, ortho-
graphic markers are obligatory in words with ir-
regular stress. The location of stress is often ex-
plicitly marked in textbooks for students of Rus-
sian. In both languages, the standard method of 
indicating stress is to place an acute accent above 
the vowel bearing primary stress, e.g., adi´os. The 
secondary stress in English can be indicated with 
a grave accent (Coleman, 2000), e.g., pr`ec´ede.
In summary, our task is to assign primary and 
secondary stress markers to stress-bearing vowels 
in an input word. The input word may be either 
phonemes or letters. If a stressed vowel is repre-
sented by more than one letter, we adopt the con-
vention of marking the first vowel of the vowel se-
quence, e.g., m´eeting. In this way, we are able to 
focus on the task of stress prediction, without hav-
ing to determine at the same time the exact sylla-
ble boundaries, or whether a vowel letter sequence 
represents one or more spoken vowels (e.g., beat-
ing vs. be-at-i-fy).
3 Automatic Stress Prediction
Our stress assignment system maps a word, w, to a 
stressed-form of the word, �w. We formulate stress 
assignment as a sequence prediction problem. The 
assignment is made in three stages:
(1) First, we map words to substrings (s), the ba-
sic units in our sequence (Section 3.1).
(2) Then, a particular stress pattern (t) is chosen 
for each substring sequence. We use a sup-
port vector machine (SVM) to rank the possi-
ble patterns for each sequence (Section 3.2).
(3) Finally, the stress pattern is used to produce
the stressed-form of the word (Section 3.3).
Table 1 gives examples of words at each stage of 
the algorithm. We discuss each step in more detail.

Table 1: The steps in our stress prediction sys-
tem (with orthographic and phonetic prediction 
examples): (1) word splitting, (2) support vector 
ranking of stress patterns, and (3) pattern-to-vowel 
mapping.
3.1 Word Splitting
The first step in our approach is to represent the 
word as a sequence of N individual units: w → 
s = {s1-s2-...-sN}. These units are used to define 
the features and outputs used by the SVM ranker. 
Although we are ultimately interested in assigning 
stress to individual vowels in the phoneme and let-
ter sequence, it is beneficial to represent the task in 
units larger than individual letters.
Our substrings are similar to syllables; they 
have a vowel as their nucleus and include con-
sonant context. By approximating syllables, our 
substring patterns will allow us to learn recur-
rent stress regularities, as well as dependencies 
between neighboring substrings. Since determin-
ing syllable breaks is a non-trivial task, we in-
stead adopt the following simple splitting tech-
nique. Each vowel in the word forms the nucleus 
of a substring. Any single preceding or follow-
ing consonant is added to the substring unit. Thus, 
each substring consists of at most three symbols 
(Table 1).
Using shorter substrings reduces the sparsity of 
our training data; words like cryer, dryer andfryer 
are all mapped to the same form: ry-er. The 
SVM can thus generalize from observed words to 
similarly-spelled, unseen examples.
Since the number of vowels equals the num-
ber of syllables in the phonetic form of the word, 
applying this approach to phonemes will always 
generate the correct number of syllables. For let-
ters, splitting may result in a different number of 
units than the true syllabification, e.g., pronounce 
→ ron-no-un-ce. This does not prevent the system 
from producing the correct stress assignment after 
the pattern-to-vowel mapping stage (Section 3.3) 
is complete. 
3.2 Stress Prediction with SVM Ranking
After creating a sequence of substring units, s = 
{s1-s2-...-sN}, the next step is to choose an out-
put sequence, t = {t1-t2-...-tN}, that encodes 
whether each unit is stressed or unstressed. We 
use the number ‘1’ to indicate that a substring re-
ceives primary stress, ‘2’ for secondary stress, and 
‘0’ to indicate no stress. We call this output se-
quence the stress pattern for a word. Table 1 gives 
examples of words, substrings, and stress patterns.
We use supervised learning to train a system to 
predict the stress pattern. We generate training 
(s, t) pairs in the obvious way from our stress- 
marked training words, �w. That is, we first ex-
tract the letter/phoneme portion, w, and use it 
to create the substrings, s. We then create the 
stress pattern, t, using �w’s stress markers. Given 
the training pairs, any sequence predictor can be 
used, for example a Conditional Random Field 
(CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) or a structured per-
ceptron (Collins, 2002). However, we can take 
advantage of a unique property of our problem to 
use a more expressive framework than is typically 
used in sequence prediction.
The key observation is that the output space of 
possible stress patterns is actually fairly limited. 
Clopper (2002) shows that people have strong 
preferences for particular sequences of stress, and 
this is confirmed by our training data (Section 4.1). 
In English, for example, we find that for each set 
of spoken words with the same number of sylla-
bles, there are no more than fifteen different stress 
patterns. In total, among 55K English training ex-
amples, there are only 70 different stress patterns. 
In both German and Dutch there are only about 
50 patterns in 250K examples.1 Therefore, for a 
particular input sequence, we can safely limit our 
consideration to only the small set of output pat-
terns of the same length.
Thus, unlike typical sequence predictors, we do 
not have to search for the highest-scoring output 
according to our model. We can enumerate the 
full set of outputs and simply choose the highest- 
scoring one. This enables a more expressive rep-
resentation. We can define arbitrary features over 
the entire output sequence. In a typical CRF or 
structured perceptron approach, only output fea-
tures that can be computed incrementally during 
search are used (e.g. Markov transition features 
that permit Viterbi search). Since search is not
1See (Dou, 2009) for more details.

needed here, we can exploit longer-range features.
Choosing the highest-scoring output from a 
fixed set is a ranking problem, and we provide the 
full ranking formulation below. Unlike previous 
ranking approaches (e.g. Collins and Koo (2005)), 
we do not rely on a generative model to produce 
a list of candidates. Candidates are chosen in ad-
vance from observed training patterns.
3.2.1 Ranking Formulation
For a substring sequence, s, of length N, our task 
is to select the correct output pattern from the set 
of all length-N patterns observed in our training 
data, a set we denote as TN. We score each possi-
ble input-output combination using a linear model. 
Each substring sequence and possible output pat-
tern, (s, t), is represented with a set of features, 
4)(s, t). The score for a particular (s, t) combina-
tion is a weighted sum of these features, A•4) (s, t). 
The specific features we use are described in Sec-
tion 3.2.2.
Let t&apos; be the stress pattern for the jth training 
sequence s&apos;, both of length N. At training time, 
the weights, A, are chosen such that for each s&apos;, 
the correct output pattern receives a higher score 
than other patterns of the same length: ∀u ∈
TN, u =� t&apos;,
A • 4)(s&apos;, t&apos;) &gt; A • 4)(s&apos;, u) (1)
The set of constraints generated by Equation 1 
are called rank constraints. They are created sep-
arately for every (s&apos;, t&apos;) training pair. Essen-
tially, each training pair is matched with a set 
of automatically-created negative examples. Each 
negative has an incorrect, but plausible, stress pat-
tern, u.
We adopt a Support Vector Machine (SVM) so-
lution to these ranking constraints as described by 
Joachims (2002). The learner finds the weights 
that ensure a maximum (soft) margin separation 
between the correct scores and the competitors. 
We use an SVM because it has been successful in 
similar settings (learning with thousands of sparse 
features) for both ranking and classification tasks, 
and because an efficient implementation is avail-
able (Joachims, 1999).
At test time we simply score each possible out-
put pattern using the learned weights. That is, 
for an input sequence s of length N, we compute 
A • 4) (s, t) for all t ∈ TN, and we take the highest 
scoring t as our output. Note that because we only

Table 2: Feature Template
consider previously-observed output patterns, it is 
impossible for our system to produce a nonsensi-
cal result, such as having two primary stresses in 
one word. Standard search-based sequence pre-
dictors need to be specially augmented with hard 
constraints in order to prevent such output (Roth 
and Yih, 2005).
3.2.2 Features
The power of our ranker to identify the correct 
stress pattern depends on how expressive our fea-
tures are. Table 2 shows the feature templates used 
to create the features 4)(s, t) for our ranker. We 
use binary features to indicate whether each com-
bination occurs in the current (s,t) pair.
For example, if a substring tion is unstressed in 
a (s, t) pair, the Substring feature {si, ti = tion,0} 
will be true.2 In English, often the penultimate 
syllable is stressed if the final syllable is tion. 
We can capture such a regularity with the Con-
text feature si+1, ti. If the following syllable is 
tion and the current syllable is stressed, the fea-
ture {si+1, ti = tion,1 } will be true. This feature 
will likely receive a positive weight, so that out-
put sequences with a stress before tion receive a 
higher rank.
Finally, the full Stress Pattern serves as an im-
portant feature. Note that such a feature would 
not be possible in standard sequence predictors, 
where such information must be decomposed into 
Markov transition features like ti— 1ti. In a ranking 
framework, we can score output sequences using 
their full output pattern. Thus we can easily learn 
the rules in languages with regular stress rules. For 
languages that do not have a fixed stress rule, pref-
erences for particular patterns can be learned using 
this feature.
2tion is a substring composed of three phonemes but we 
use its orthographic representation here for clarity.
121
3.3 Pattern-to-Vowel Mapping
The final stage of our system uses the predicted 
pattern t to create the stress-marked form of the 
word, W. Note the number of substrings created 
by our splitting method always equals the number 
of vowels in the word. We can thus simply map 
the indicator numbers in t to markers on their cor-
responding vowels to produce the stressed word.
For our example, pronounce —* ron-no-un-ce, 
if the SVM chooses the stress pattern, 0-1-0- 
0, we produce the correct stress-marked word, 
pron´ounce. If we instead stress the third vowel, 0- 
0-1-0, we produce an incorrect output, prono´unce.
4 Stress Prediction Experiments
In this section, we evaluate our ranking approach 
to stress prediction by assigning stress to spoken 
and written words in three languages: English, 
German, and Dutch. We first describe the data and 
the various systems we evaluate, and then provide 
the results.
4.1 Data
The data is extracted from CELEX (Baayen et al., 
1996). Following previous work on stress predic-
tion, we randomly partition the data into 85% for 
training, 5% for development, and 10% for test-
ing. To make results on German and Dutch com-
parable with English, we reduce the training, de-
velopment, and testing set by 80% for each. Af-
ter removing all duplicated items as well as abbre-
viations, phrases, and diacritics, each training set 
contains around 55K words.
In CELEX, stress is labeled on syllables in the 
phonetic form of the words. Since our objec-
tive is to assign stress markers to vowels (as de-
scribed in Section 2) we automatically map the 
stress markers from the stressed syllables in the 
phonetic forms onto phonemes and letters rep-
resenting vowels. For phonemes, the process is 
straightforward: we move the stress marker from 
the beginning of a syllable to the phoneme which 
constitutes the nucleus of the syllable. For let-
ters, we map the stress from the vowel phoneme 
onto the orthographic forms using the ALINE al-
gorithm (Dwyer and Kondrak, 2009). The stress 
marker is placed on the first letter within the sylla-
ble that represents a vowel sound .3

CELEX also provides secondary stress annota-
tion for English. We therefore evaluate on both 
primary and secondary stress (P+S) in English and 
on primary stress assignment alone (P) for En-
glish, German, and Dutch.
4.2 Comparison Approaches
We evaluate three different systems on the letter 
and phoneme sequences in the experimental data:
1) SUBSTRING is the system presented in Sec-
tion 3.	It uses the vowel-based splitting
method, followed by SVM ranking.
2) ORACLESYL splits the input word into sylla-
bles according to the CELEX gold-standard, 
before applying SVM ranking. The output 
pattern is evaluated directly against the gold- 
standard, without pattern-to-vowel mapping.
3) TOPPATTERN is our baseline system. It uses 
the vowel-based splitting method to produce a 
substring sequence of length N. Then it simply 
chooses the most common stress pattern among 
all the stress patterns of length N.
SUBSTRING and ORACLESYL use scores pro-
duced by an SVM ranker trained on the training 
data. We employ the ranking mode of the popular 
learning package SVM&quot;ght (Joachims, 1999). In 
each case, we learn a linear kernel ranker on the 
training set stress patterns and tune the parameter 
that trades-off training error and margin on the de-
velopment set.
We evaluate the systems using word accuracy: 
the percent of words for which the output form of 
the word, w, matches the gold standard.
4.3 Results
Table 3 provides results on English, German, and 
Dutch phonemes. Overall, the performance of our 
automatic stress predictor, SUBSTRING, is excel-
lent. It achieves 98.0% accuracy for predicting

primary stress in English, 97.1% in German, and 
93.1% in Dutch. It also predicts both primary and 
secondary stress in English with high accuracy, 
96.2%. Performance is much higher than our base-
line accuracy, which is between 60% and 70%. 
ORACLESYL, with longer substrings and hence 
sparser data, does not generally improve perfor-
mance. This indicates that perfect syllabification 
is unnecessary for phonetic stress assignment.
Our system is a major advance over the pre-
vious state-of-the-art in phonetic stress assign-
ment. For predicting stressed/unstressed syllables 
in English, Black et al. (1998) obtained a per- 
syllable accuracy of 94.6%. We achieve 96.2% 
per-word accuracy for predicting both primary and 
secondary stress. Others report lower numbers 
on English phonemes. Bagshaw (1998) obtained 
65%-83.3% per-syllable accuracy using Church 
(1985)’s rule-based system. For predicting both 
primary and secondary stress, Coleman (2000) 
and Pearson et al. (2000) report 69.8% and 81.0% 
word accuracy, respectively.
The performance on letters (Table 4) is also 
quite encouraging. SUBSTRING predicts primary 
stress with accuracy above 95% for English and 
German, and equal to 91% in Dutch. Performance 
is 1-3% lower on letters than on phonemes. On 
the other hand, the performance of ORACLESYL 
drops much less on letters. This indicates that 
most of SUBSTRING’s errors are caused by the 
splitting method. Letter vowels may or may not 
represent spoken vowels. By creating a substring 
for every vowel letter we may produce an incorrect 
number of syllables. Our pattern feature is there-
fore less effective.
Nevertheless, SUBSTRING’s accuracy on letters 
also represents a clear improvement over previ-
ous work. Webster (2004) reports 80.3% word 
accuracy on letters in English and 81.2% in Ger-
man. The most comparable work is Demberg et al.

Number of training examples
Figure 1: Stress prediction accuracy on letters.
(2007), which achieves 90.1% word accuracy on 
letters in German CELEX, assuming perfect letter 
syllabification. In order to reproduce their strict 
experimental setup, we re-partition the full set of 
German CELEX data to ensure that no overlap of 
word stems exists between the training and test 
sets. Using the new data sets, our system achieves 
a word accuracy of 92.3%, a 2.2% improvement 
over Demberg et al. (2007)’s result. Moreover, if 
we also assume perfect syllabification, the accu-
racy is 94.3%, a 40% reduction in error rate.
We performed a detailed analysis to understand 
the strong performance of our system. First of all, 
note that an error could happen if a test-set stress 
pattern was not observed in the training data; its 
correct stress pattern would not be considered as 
an output. In fact, no more than two test errors in 
any test set were so caused. This strongly justi-
fies the reduced set of outputs used in our ranking 
formulation.
We also tested all systems with the Stress Pat-
tern feature removed. Results were worse in all 
cases. As expected, it is most valuable for pre-
dicting primary and secondary stress. On English 
phonemes, accuracy drops from 96.2% to 95.3% 
without it. On letters, it drops from 93.5% to 
90.0%. The gain from this feature also validates 
our ranking framework, as such arbitrary features 
over the entire output sequence can not be used in 
standard search-based sequence prediction.
Finally, we examined the relationship between 
training data size and performance by plotting 
learning curves for letter stress accuracy (Fig-
ure 1). Unlike the tables above, here we use the

full set of data in Dutch and German CELEX to 
create the largest-possible training sets (255K ex-
amples). None of the curves are levelling off; per-
formance grows log-linearly across the full range.
5 Lexical stress and L2P conversion
In this section, we evaluate various methods of 
combining stress prediction with phoneme gener-
ation. We first describe the specific system that we 
use for letter-to-phoneme (L2P) conversion. We 
then discuss the different ways stress prediction 
can be integrated with L2P, and define the systems 
used in our experiments. Finally, we provide the 
results.
5.1 The L2P system
We combine stress prediction with a state-of-the- 
art L2P system (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008). Like 
our stress ranker, their system is a data-driven se-
quence predictor that is trained with supervised 
learning. The score for each output sequence is 
a weighted combination of features. The feature 
weights are trained using the Margin Infused Re-
laxed Algorithm (MIRA) (Crammer and Singer, 
2003), a powerful online discriminative training 
framework. Like other recent L2P systems (Bisani 
and Ney, 2002; Marchand and Damper, 2007; Ji-
ampojamarn et al., 2007), this approach does not 
generate stress, nor does it consider stress when it 
generates phonemes.
For L2P experiments, we use the same training, 
testing, and development data as was used in Sec-
tion 4. For all experiments, we use the develop-
ment set to determine at which iteration to stop 
training in the online algorithm.
5.2 Combining stress and phoneme 
generation
Various methods have been used for combining 
stress and phoneme generation. Phonemes can be 
generated without regard to stress, with stress as-
signed as a post-process (Bagshaw, 1998; Cole-
man, 2000). Both van den Bosch (1997) and 
Black et al. (1998) argue that stress should be pre-
dicted at the same time as phonemes. They ex-
pand the output set to distinguish between stressed 
and unstressed phonemes. Similarly, Demberg et 
al. (2007) produce phonemes, stress, and syllable- 
boundaries within a single joint n-gram model. 
Pearson et al. (2000) generate phonemes and stress 
together by jointly optimizing a decision-tree
phoneme-generator and a stress predictor based on 
stress pattern counts. In contrast, Webster (2004) 
first assigns stress to letters, creating an expanded 
input set, and then predicts both phonemes and 
stress jointly. The system marks stress on let-
ter vowels by determining the correspondence be-
tween affixes and stress in written words.
Following the above approaches, we can expand 
the input or output symbols of our L2P system to 
include stress. However, since both decision tree 
systems and our L2P predictor utilize only local 
context, they may produce invalid global output. 
One option, used by Demberg et al. (2007), is to 
add a constraint to the output generation, requiring 
each output sequence to have exactly one primary 
stress.
We enhance this constraint, based on the obser-
vation that the number of valid output sequences 
is fairly limited (Section 3.2). The modified sys-
tem produces the highest-scoring sequence such 
that the output’s corresponding stress pattern has 
been observed in our training data. We call this 
the stress pattern constraint. This is a tighter 
constraint than having only one primary stress.4 
Another advantage is that it provides some guid-
ance for the assignment of secondary stress.
Inspired by the aforementioned strategies, we 
evaluate the following approaches:
1) JOINT: The L2P system’s input sequence is let-
ters, the output sequence is phonemes+stress.
2) JOINT+CONSTR: Same as JOINT, except it se-
lects the highest scoring output that obeys the 
stress pattern constraint.
3) POSTPROCESS: The L2P system’s input is let-
ters, the output is phonemes. It then applies the 
SVM stress ranker (Section 3) to the phonemes 
to produce the full phoneme+stress output.
4) LETTERSTRESS: The L2P system’s input is 
letters+stress, the output is phonemes+stress. 
It creates the stress-marked letters by applying 
the SVM ranker to the input letters as a pre-
process.
5) ORACLESTRESS: The same input/output as 
LETTERSTRESS, except it uses the gold- 
standard stress on letters (Section 4.1).
4In practice, the L2P system generates a top-N list, and 
we take the highest-scoring output on the list that satisfies 
the constraint. If none satisfy the constraint, we take the top 
output that has only one primary stress.

Note that while the first approach uses only 
local information to make predictions (features 
within a context window around the current let-
ter), systems 2 to 5 leverage global information in 
some manner: systems 3 and 4 use the predictions 
of our stress ranker, while 2 uses a global stress 
pattern constraint.5
We also generated stress and phonemes using 
the popular Festival Speech Synthesis System6 
(version 1.96, 2004) and report its accuracy.
5.3 Results
Word accuracy results for predicting both 
phonemes and stress are provided in Table 5. 
First of all, note that the JOINT approach, 
which simply expands the output set, is 4%- 
8% worse than all other comparison systems 
across the three languages. These results clearly 
indicate the drawbacks of predicting stress us-
ing only local information. In English, both 
LETTERSTRESS and POSTPROCESS perform 
best, while POSTPROCESS and the constrained 
system are highest on German and Dutch. Results 
using the oracle letter stress show that given 
perfect stress assignment on letters, phonemes 
and stress can be predicted very accurately, in all 
cases above 91%.
We also found that the phoneme prediction ac-
curacy alone (i.e., without stress) is quite simi-
lar for all the systems. The gains over JOINT 
on combined stress and phoneme accuracy are 
almost entirely due to more accurate stress as-
signment. Utilizing the oracle stress on letters 
markedly improves phoneme prediction in English
5This constraint could also help the other systems. How-
ever, since they already use global information, it yields only 
marginal improvements.

(from 88.8% to 91.4%). This can be explained by 
the fact that English vowels are often reduced to 
schwa when unstressed (Section 2).
Predicting both phonemes and stress is a chal-
lenging task, and each of our globally-informed 
systems represents a major improvement over pre-
vious work. The accuracy of Festival is much 
lower even than our JOINT approach, but the rel-
ative performance on the different languages is 
quite similar.
A few papers report accuracy on the combined 
stress and phoneme prediction task. The most di-
rectly comparable work is van den Bosch (1997), 
which also predicts primary and secondary stress 
using English CELEX data. However, the re-
ported word accuracy is only 62.1%. Three other 
papers report word accuracy on phonemes and 
stress, using different data sets. Pearson et al. 
(2000) report 58.5% word accuracy for predicting 
phonemes and primary/secondary stress. Black et 
al. (1998) report 74.6% word accuracy in English, 
while Webster (2004) reports 68.2% on English 
and 82.9% in German (all primary stress only). 
Finally, Demberg et al. (2007) report word accu-
racy on predicting phonemes, stress, and syllab-
ification on German CELEX data. They achieve 
86.3% word accuracy.
6 Conclusion
We have presented a discriminative ranking ap-
proach to lexical stress prediction, which clearly 
outperforms previously developed systems. The 
approach is largely language-independent, appli-
cable to both orthographic and phonetic repre-
sentations, and flexible enough to handle multi-
ple stress levels. When combined with an exist-
ing L2P system, it achieves impressive accuracy 
in generating pronunciations together with their 
stress patterns. In the future, we will investigate 
additional features to leverage syllabic and mor-
phological information, when available. Kernel 
functions could also be used to automatically cre-
ate a richer feature space; preliminary experiments 
have shown gains in performance using polyno-
mial and RBF kernels with our stress ranker.
