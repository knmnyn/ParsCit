ABSTRACT
Recent computer technologies have enabled fast high-quality 
3D graphics on personal computers, and also have made 
the development of 3D graphical applications easier. How-
ever, most of such technologies do not sufficiently support 
layout and behavior aspects of 3D graphics. Geometric con-
straints are, in general, a powerful tool for specifying layouts 
and behaviors of graphical objects, and have been applied 
to 2D graphical user interfaces and specialized 3D graph-
ics packages. In this paper, we present Chorus3D, a geo-
metric constraint library for 3D graphical applications. It 
enables programmers to use geometric constraints for vari-
ous purposes such as geometric layout, constrained dragging, 
and inverse kinematics. Its novel feature is to handle scene 
graphs by processing coordinate transformations in geomet-
ric constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate the usefulness of 
Chorus3D by presenting sample constraint-based 3D graph-
ical applications.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in commodity hardware have enabled fast 
high-quality 3D graphics on personal computers. Also, soft-
ware technologies such as VRML and Java 3D have made the 
development of 3D graphical applications easier. However, 
most of such technologies mainly focus on rendering aspects 
of 3D graphics, and do not sufficiently support layout and 
behavior aspects.
Constraints are, in general, a powerful tool for specifying 
layouts and behaviors of graphical objects. It is widely 
recognized that constraints facilitate describing geometric 
layouts and behaviors of diagrams in 2D graphical user in-
terfaces such as drawing editors, and therefore constraint 
solvers for this purpose have been extensively studied [3, 7,

8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18]. Also, many specialized 3D graph-
ics packages enable the specification of object layouts and 
behaviors by using constraints or similar functions.
It is natural to consider that various 3D graphical applica-
tions can also be enhanced by incorporating constraints. It 
might seem sufficient for this purpose to modify existing 2D 
geometric constraint solvers to support 3D geometry. It is, 
however, insufficient in reality because of the essential dif-
ference between the ways of specifying 2D and 3D graphics; 
typical 2D graphics handles only simple coordinate systems, 
whereas most 3D graphics requires multiple coordinate sys-
tems with complex relations such as rotations to treat scene 
graphs. It means that we need to additionally support coor-
dinate transformations in 3D geometric constraint solvers.
In this paper, we present Chorus3D, a geometric constraint 
library for 3D graphical applications. The novel feature of 
Chorus3D is to handle scene graphs by processing coordi-
nate transformations in geometric constraint satisfaction. 
We have realized Chorus3D by adding this feature to our 
previous 2D geometric constraint library Chorus [13].
Another important point of Chorus3D is that it inherits from 
Chorus the capability to handle “soft” constraints with hier-
archical strengths or preferences (i.e., constraint hierarchies 
[7]), which are useful for specifying default layouts and be-
haviors of graphical objects. It determines solutions so that 
they satisfy as many strong constraints as possible, leaving 
weaker inconsistent constraints unsatisfied.
Chorus3D also inherits from Chorus a module mechanism 
which allows user-defined kinds of geometric constraints. 
This feature enables programmers to use geometric con-
straints for various purposes including the following:
Geometric layout: A typical use of Chorus3D is to lay 
out graphical objects. For example, it allows putting 
objects parallel or perpendicular to others without re-
quiring predetermined positioning parameters. Also, it 
provides constraint-based general graph layout based 
on the spring model [14].
Constrained dragging: Chorus3D enables dragging ob-
jects with positioning constraints. For example, it 
can constrain a dragged object to be on the surface 
of a sphere. Constrained dragging is important for 3D 
graphics because it provides a sophisticated way to ac-
94
Translation: A translation transformation is characterized 
with three variables tx, tr, and tz, and specifies the 
translation of vector (tx,tr, tz).
Rotation: A rotation transformation is parameterized with 
four variables rx, rr, rz, and rw, and specifies the ro-
tation of angle rw about the axis (rx, rr, rz).
Scale: A scale transformation is represented with three 
variables sx, sr, and sz, and specifies the axis-wise 
scale (sx, sr, sz) about the origin.
We can express many practically useful transformations by 
using such elemental ones. In fact, any transformations rep-
resented with Transform nodes in VRML can be realized by 
combining these kinds of transformations [4].
3. CONSTRAINT FRAMEWORK
In this section, we briefly describe our framework for han-
dling constraints. We base it on the framework for the 2D 
version of the Chorus constraint solver. See [13] for further 
detail.
3.1 Problem Formulation
We first present the mathematical formulation for modeling 
constraints and constraint systems. In the following, we 
write x to represent a variable vector (x1, x2, ... , xn) of 
n variables, and also v to indicate a variable value vector 
(v1, v2, ... , vn) of n real numbers (vi expresses the value of 
xi).
To support various geometric constraints in a uniform man-
ner, we adopt error functions as a means of expressing con-
straints. An error function e(x) is typically associated with 
a single arithmetic constraint, and is defined as a func-
tion from variable value vectors to errors expressed as non- 
negative real numbers; that is, e(v) gives the error of the 
associated constraint for v. An error function returns a zero 
if and only if the constraint is exactly satisfied. For example, 
e(x) = (xi — xj)2 can be used for the constraint xi = xj. 
We assume that, for each e(x), its gradient is known:
De(x) =	�ae(x) ae(x) ae(x) ax1,ax2 ,...,axn )
In the same way as constraint hierarchies [7], constraint sys-
tems in our framework can be divided into levels consisting 
of constraints with equal strengths. Constraints with the 
strongest preference are said to be required (or hard), and 
are guaranteed to be always satisfied (if it is impossible, 
there will be no solution). By contrast, constraints with 
weaker preferences are said to be preferential (or soft), and 
may be relaxed if they conflict with stronger constraints.
Solutions to constraint systems are defined as follows: let 
ei,j(x) be the error function of the j-th constraint (1 &lt; j &lt; 
mi) at strength level i (0 &lt; i &lt; l); then solutions v are 
determined with the optimization problem
minimize	E(v) subject to e0,j (v) = 0 (1 &lt; j &lt; m0)

commodate ordinary mouse dragging to 3D spaces.
Inverse kinematics: Chorus3D is applicable to inverse 
kinematics, which is a problem of finding desired con-
figurations of “articulated” objects [1, 20]. It allows 
the specification of articulated objects by using coor-
dinate transformations, and can automatically calcu-
late the parameters of the transformations that satisfy 
constraints. This method is also applicable to camera 
control by aiming at a possibly moving target object.
In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of Chorus3D 
by presenting sample constraint-based 3D graphical appli-
cations.
This paper is organized as follows: We first present our ap-
proach to the use of constraints for 3D graphics. Second, 
we describe our basic framework of constraints. Next, we 
present a method for processing coordinate transformations 
in our framework. We then provide the implementation of 
Chorus3D, and demonstrate examples of using constraints 
in 3D graphics. After giving related work and discussion, we 
mention the conclusions and future work of this research.
2. OUR APPROACH
In this research, we integrate geometric constraints with 3D 
graphics. Basically, we realize this by extending our previ-
ous 2D geometric constraint solver Chorus [13] to support 
3D geometry. However, as already mentioned, it is not a 
straightforward task because 3D graphics typically requires 
handling scene graphs with hierarchical structures of coor-
dinate systems, which is not covered by the 2D version of 
the Chorus constraint solver.
To support hierarchies of coordinate systems, we introduce 
the following new model of constraints:
Point variables: Each point variable (which consists of 
three real-valued constrainable variables) is associated 
with one coordinate system, and its value is expressed 
as local coordinates.
Geometric constraints: Geometric constraints on point 
variables are evaluated by using the world coordinates 
of the point variables (they can also refer to 1D vari-
ables for, e.g., distances and angles by using their val-
ues directly). A single constraint can refer to point 
variables belonging to different coordinate systems.
Coordinate transformations: Parameters of coordinate 
transformations are provided as constrainable vari-
ables, and the solver is allowed to change the param-
eters of transformations to appropriately satisfy given 
constraints.
With this model, we can gain the benefit of the easy mainte-
nance of geometric relations by using constraints, as well as 
the convenience of modeling geometric objects by employing 
scene graphs.
In our actual implementation, we provide the following three 
elemental kinds of coordinate transformations:
95
where E is an objective function defined as
wiei,j (x)
in which wi indicates the weight associated with strength i, 
and the relation w1 » w2 » . . . » wl holds. In this formu-
lation, level 0 corresponds to required constraints, and the 
others to preferential ones. Intuitively, more weighted (or 
stronger) preferential constraints should be more satisfied.
Our framework simulates constraint hierarchies. Particu-
larly, if the squares of constraint violations are used to com-
pute error functions, a system in our framework will obtain 
approximate solutions to the similar hierarchy solved with 
the criterion least-squares-better [3, 17]. The largest differ-
ence is that a system in our framework slightly considers a 
weak constraint inconsistent with a stronger satisfiable one 
in computing its solutions, while the similar hierarchy would 
discard such a weak one.
Our actual implementation of the Chorus3D constraint 
solver provides four external strengths required, strong, 
medium, and weak as well as two internal strengths very 
strong (used to approximately handle required nonlinear 
or inequality constraints) and very weak (exploited to make 
new solutions as close to previous ones as possible). It typ-
ically assigns weights 324, 323, 322, 321, and 1 to strengths 
very strong, strong, medium, weak, and very weak respec-
tively. These weights were determined according to the pre-
cision of the actual numerical algorithm (described in the 
next subsection). To know how much these weights affect 
solutions, suppose a system of strong constraint x = 0 and 
medium one x = 100. Then the unique solution will be ob-
tained as x = 3.0303 . . . (= 100/33). Thus the difference of 
strengths is obvious. According to our actual experience, 
this precision allows us to discriminate constraint strengths 
in most graphical applications.
3.2 Algorithm
To actually find solutions to constraint systems presented 
above, we need to solve their corresponding optimization 
problems. For this purpose, we designed a constraint sat-
isfaction algorithm by combining a numerical optimization 
technique with a genetic algorithm. It uses numerical op-
timization to find local solutions, while it adopts a genetic 
algorithm to search for global solutions.
For numerical optimization, we mainly use the quasi-Newton 
method based on Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Sahnno updat-
ing formula [2, 6], which is a fast iterative technique that 
exhibits superlinear convergence. Since it excludes fruit-
less searches by utilizing its history, it is usually faster than 
straightforward Newton’s method.
We introduced a genetic algorithm to alleviate the problem 
that some kinds of geometric constraints suffer from local op-
timal but global non-optimal solutions [11, 16]. Generally, 
a genetic algorithm is a stochastic search method that re-
peatedly transforms a population of potential solutions into 
another next-generation population [10, 15]. We typically 
necessitate it only for computing initial solutions; in other 
words, we can usually re-solve modified constraint systems
without the genetic algorithm, only by applying numerical 
optimization to previous solutions.
4. PROCESSING COORDINATE 
TRANSFORMATIONS
In this section, we propose a method for integrating coordi-
nate transformations with our constraint framework.
As already mentioned, we use world coordinates of points 
to evaluate 3D geometric constraints. A naive method for 
this is to duplicate point variables in all ancestor coordinate 
systems, and then to impose required constraints that rep-
resent coordinate transformations between the point vari-
ables. However, this method requires an optimization rou-
tine supporting required nonlinear constraints, which lim-
its the availability of actual techniques (in fact, we cannot 
use the quasi-Newton method for this purpose). Also, this 
method tends to yield many variables and constraints, and 
therefore requires an extra amount of memory.
Below we propose a more widely applicable method for han-
dling coordinate transformations. Its characteristic is to 
hide transformations from optimization routines, which is 
realized by embedding transformations in error functions.
4.1 Model
To begin with, we introduce another variable vector x&apos; = 
(x&apos;1, x&apos;2, ... ,x&apos; n), which is created by replacing variables for 
local coordinates of 3D points in x with the corresponding 
ones for world coordinates (1D variables remain the same). 
We can mathematically model this process as follows: Con-
sider the sequence of the s transformations
t0	t1	s 2	ts 1
y0 (= x)� y1 �... t y3-1 —� y3 (= x&apos;)
where y0 and y3 are equal to x and x&apos; respectively, each 
yk (1 &lt; k &lt; s — 1) is an “intermediate” vector, and each tk 
(0 &lt; k &lt; s — 1) is a function that transforms yk into yk+1. 
Intuitively, tk corresponds to a coordinate transformation, 
and transforms related point variables from its source co-
ordinate system into its destination system. It should be 
noted that, although transformations are, in general, hier-
archical (or tree-structured), we can always find such a linear 
sequence by “serializing” them in an appropriate order.
By using such transformations, we can compute x&apos; as fol-
lows:
x&apos; = t3-1(t3-2(...(t1(t0(x))) ... )) = t(x)
where t is defined as the composition of all the elemental 
transformations. In the following description, we write yk,i 
to denote the i-th element of yk, and also tk,i to represent 
the i-th element of tk; that is,
yk+1 = (yk+1,1 , yk+1,2, ... , yk+1,n)
= (tk,1(yk),tk,2(yk), ..., tk,n(yk)) = tk(yk).
4.2 Method
Geometric constraints are evaluated by using world coordi-
nates of points, which means that their error functions are

defined as e(x&apos;). Using the composed transformations, we	parameter of the coordinate transformation), we have
can evaluate them as	yk,i = xi, which means that we have atk,j(yk)/axi.
e(x&apos;) = e(t(x)).	Therefore, we can compute ae(x&apos;)/axi immediately.
Importantly, we can efficiently realize this computation by 
applying only necessary transformations to actually used 
variables.
We also need to compute the gradient of e(t(x)), i.e.,
�ae(t(x)) ae(t(x)) ae(t(x))  
ax1 , ax2 , ..., axn ) .
Basically, we can decompose each partial derivative 
ae(t(x))/axi into primitive expressions by repeatedly us-
ing the chain rule. However, we should avoid the simple 
application of the chain rule since it would result in a large 
number of expressions.
Instead, we perform a controlled way of decomposing such 
partial derivatives; it appropriately arranges the chain rule 
to restrict the computation to only necessary components. 
First, we decompose ae(t(x))/axi as follows:
ats-1,j,(ys-1)
axi
ae(x&apos;)	ats-1,j,(ys-1)ats-2,js_1(ys-2)
axj,Eays-1,js_1	axi
js_1
ats-2,js_1(ys-2)
axi
ae(x&apos;) ats-2,js_1(ys-2)
ays-1,js_1	axi	.
Note that each ae(x&apos;)/ax&apos;j, is given by the defini-
tion of the geometric constraint, and also that each
ats-1,j,(ys-1)/ays-1,js_1 is a partial derivative in the gra-
dient of a single coordinate transformation ts-1. Thus we
can obtain each ae(x&apos;)/ays-1 ,js_1. Also, by repeating this
process, we can compute, for each k,
atk-1,jk (yk-1)
and finally achieve
ae(t(x))
axi
where each at0,j1(x)/axi is a component of the gradient of
t0. Therefore, ae(t(x))/axi is now determined.
Furthermore, we can considerably reduce the number of the 
computations of ae(x&apos;)/ayk,jk in practice. We can make the 
following observations about the above computation:
9 For each variable xj,, ae(x&apos;)/ax&apos;j, can be non-zero only 
if xj,is actually needed to evaluate the designated con-
straint.
9 If xi is originated in the coordinate system associated 
with tk (that is, xi is either a local coordinate or a
These observations reveal that we need to transfer a partial 
derivative ae(x&apos;)/ayk,j to the next step only when xj rep-
resents a really necessary coordinate that has not reached 
its local coordinate system. Also, since we can handle each 
necessary point independently, we can implement this pro-
cess with a linear recursive function that hands over only 
three derivatives ae(x&apos;)/ayk,j at each recursive call.
5. IMPLEMENTATION
We implemented the proposed method by developing a con-
straint solver called Chorus3D, which is a 3D extension to 
our previous 2D geometric constraint solver Chorus [13]. We 
constructed Chorus3D as a C++ class library, and also de-
veloped a native method interface to make it available to 
Java programs.
Chorus3D allows programmers to add a new kind of arith-
metic constraints (e.g., Euclidean geometric constraints) by 
constructing a new constraint class with a method that eval-
uates their error functions. Also, programmers can intro-
duce a new kind of non-arithmetic (or pseudo) constraints 
(for, e.g., general graph layout) by developing a new evalua-
tion module which computes an “aggregate” error function 
for a given set of constraints.
Chorus3D currently provides linear equality, linear inequal-
ity, edit (update a variable value), stay (fix a variable value), 
Euclidean geometric constraints (for, e.g., parallelism, per-
pendicularity, and distance equality), and graph layout con-
straints based on the spring model [14]. Linear equality/ 
inequality constraints can refer to only 1D variables (includ-
ing elements of 3D point variables), while edit and stay con-
straints can be associated with 1D and 3D point variables. 
Euclidean geometric constraints typically refer to point vari-
ables although they sometimes require 1D variables for an-
gles and distances. Each graph layout constraint represents 
a graph edge, and refers to two point variables as its asso-
ciated graph nodes. As stated earlier, constraints on such 
point variables are evaluated by using world coordinates of 
the points. Also, a single constraint can refer to point vari-
ables belonging to different coordinate systems.
The application programming interface of Chorus3D is a 
natural extension to that of Chorus, which provides a certain 
compatibility with a recent linear solver called Cassowary 
[3]; in a similar way to Cassowary and Chorus, Chorus3D 
allows programmers to process constraint systems by cre-
ating variables and constraints as objects, and by adding/ 
removing constraint objects to/from the solver object. In 
addition, Chorus3D handles coordinate transformations as 
objects, and presents an interface for arranging them hier-
archically.
6. EXAMPLES
In this section, we present three examples to demonstrate 
how to incorporate geometric constraints into 3D graphics 
by using the Chorus3D constraint solver. All the examples 
are implemented in Java by using Java 3D as a graphics

programming interface as well as the native method interface 
with Chorus3D. We also provide computation times taken 
for constraint satisfaction in these examples.
6.1 Graph Layout
The first example is an application which lays out a set 
of points with a general graph structure in a 3D space as 
shown in Figure 1. This application also allows a user to
drag graph nodes with a mouse.&apos; The used graph layout
technique is based on a 3D extension to the spring model 
[14]. This kind of 3D graph layout is practically useful to 
information visualization, and has actually been adopted in 
a certain system [19].
The constraint system of this graph layout consists of 26 
point variables (i.e., 78 real-valued variables), 31 graph lay-
out constraints, and three linear equality constraints for fix-
ing one of the point variables at the origin. When executed 
on an 866 MHz Pentium III processor running Linux 2.2.16, 
Chorus3D obtained an initial solution in 456 milliseconds. It 
performed constraint satisfaction typically within 250 mil-
liseconds to reflect the user’s dragging a graph node.
6.2 Constrained Dragging
The second example is an application which allows a user 
to drag an object constrained to be on another spherical 
object. Figure 2 depicts this application, where the smaller 
solid spherical object is constrained to be on the surface of 
the larger wireframe one. The application declares a strong 
Euclidean geometric constraint which specifies a constant 
distance between the centers of these objects. When the 
user tries to drag the smaller object with a mouse, the appli-
cation imposes another medium Euclidean constraint which 
collinearly locates the viewpoint, the 3D position of the 
mouse cursor (which is considered to be on the screen), and
&apos;Unlike constrained dragging in the next example, this
mouse operation is simply implemented with Java 3D’s 
PickMouseBehavior classes.

the center of the dragged object as shown in Figure 3. This 
collinearity constraint reflects the motion of the mouse in 
the position of the dragged object. Since the collinearity 
constraint is weaker than the first Euclidean constraint, the 
user cannot drag the smaller object to the outside of the 
larger sphere.
The application initially declares one Euclidean geometric 
constraint on two point variables, and solved it in 1 mil-
lisecond on the same computer as the first example. When 
the user tries to drag the smaller object, it adds another 
Euclidean constraint as well as two edit constraints for the 
viewpoint and mouse position. The solver maintained this 
constraint system usually within 2 milliseconds.
6.3 Inverse Kinematics
The final example applies inverse kinematics to a virtual 
robot arm by using constraints. Unlike the previous ex-
amples, it takes advantage of coordinate transformations to 
express its constraint system.

(d)	(e)	(f)
As illustrated in Figure 4(a), the robot arm consists of four 
parts called a base, a shoulder, an upper arm, and a forearm. 
Constraint satisfaction for inverse kinematics is performed 
to position its hand (the end of the forearm) at the target 
object if possible, or otherwise to make it maximally close 
to the target. Figures 4(b)–(f) show the movement of the 
robot arm. In Figures 4(b)–(e), its hand is positioned at 
the exact location of the target by using appropriate angles 
of its joints. By contrast, in Figure 4(f), the hand cannot 
reach the target, and therefore the arm is extended toward 
the target instead.
Figure 5 describes the constraint program used in the robot 
arm application. After constructing a constraint solver 
s, it creates six coordinate transformations shldrTTfm, 
shldrRTfm, uarmTTfm, uarmRTfm, farmTTfm, and farmRTfm. 
Here the rotation angle parameters of the rotation trans-
formations shldrRTfm, uarmRTfm, and farmRTfm will actu-
ally work as variables that can be altered by the solver. 
Next, it generates a point variable handPos to represent 
the position of the hand, and then suggests the target po-
sition to the hand by using a preferential edit constraint 
editHandPos. Finally, executing the solver, it obtains the 
desired angles shldrAngle, uarmAngle, and farmAngle of
the rotation transformations. These angles will be passed 
to the Java 3D library to render the properly configured 
robot arm.
This program generates a constraint system which contains 
three translation and three rotation transformations, one ex-
plicit point variable as well as six point variables and three 
1D variables for coordinate transformations, and one edit 
constraint. The solver found an initial solution to this sys-
tem in 18 milliseconds, and obtained each new solution for 
a frame update typically within 10 milliseconds.
7. RELATED WORK AND DISCUSSION
There has been work on integrating constraints or similar 
functions with 3D graphics languages to facilitate the spec-
ification of graphical objects. For example, we can view the 
event routing mechanism in VRML [4] as a limited form of 
one-way propagation constraints. Also, there is an attempt 
to extend VRML by introducing one-way propagation and 
finite-domain combinatorial constraints [5]. However, they 
cannot handle more powerful simultaneous nonlinear con-
straints such as Euclidean geometric constraints.
Although many constraint solvers have been developed in

the field of graphical user interfaces [3, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18], 
most of them do not provide special treatment for 3D graph-
ics. In general, the role of nonlinear geometric constraints 
is more important in 3D applications than in 2D interfaces. 
Most importantly, 3D graphics usually requires rotations of 
objects which are rarely used in 2D interfaces. The main 
reason is that we often equally treat all “horizontal” direc-
tions in a 3D space even if we may clearly distinguish them 
from “vertical” directions. Therefore, nonlinear constraint 
solvers are appropriate for 3D applications. In addition, co-
ordinate transformations should be supported since they are 
typically used to handle rotations of objects.
Gleicher proposed the differential approach [8, 9], which sup-
ports 3D geometric constraints and coordinate transforma-
tions. In a sense, it shares a motivation with Chorus3D; in 
addition to support for 3D graphics, it allows user-defined 
kinds of geometric constraints. However, it is based on a dif-
ferent solution method from Chorus3D; it realizes constraint 
satisfaction by running virtual dynamic simulations. This 
difference results in a quite different behavior of solutions as 
well as an interface for controlling solutions. By contrast, 
Chorus3D provides a much more compatible interface with 
recent successful solvers such as Cassowary [3].
Much research on inverse kinematics has been conducted in 
the fields of computer graphics and robotics [1, 20]. How-
ever, inverse kinematics is typically implemented as special-
ized software which only provides limited kinds of geometric
constraints.
Chorus3D has two limitations in its algorithm: one is on the 
precision of solutions determined by preferential constraints; 
the other is on the speed of the satisfaction of large con-
straint systems. These limitations are mainly caused by the 
treatment of multi-level preferences of constraints in addi-
tion to required constraints (i.e., constraint hierarchies). Al-
though many numerical optimization techniques have been 
proposed and implemented in the field of mathematical pro-
gramming [2, 6], most of them do not handle preferential 
constraints. To alleviate the limitations of Chorus3D, we 
are pursuing a more sophisticated method for processing 
multi-level preferential constraints.
We implemented Chorus3D as a class library which can 
be exploited in C++ and Java programs. However, more 
high-level authoring tools will also be useful for declarative 
approaches to 3D design. One possible direction is to ex-
tend VRML [4] to support geometric constraints. Standard 
VRML requires scripts in Java or JavaScript to realize com-
plex layouts and behaviors. By contrast, constraint-enabled 
VRML will cover a wider range of applications without such 
additional scripts.
8. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we presented Chorus3D, a geometric con-
straint library for 3D graphical applications. It enables pro-
grammers to use geometric constraints for various purposes
100
such as geometric layout, constrained dragging, and inverse 
kinematics. Its novel feature is to handle scene graphs 
by processing coordinate transformations in geometric con-
straint satisfaction.
Our future work includes the development of other kinds of 
geometric constraints to further prove the usefulness of our 
approach. In particular, we are planning to implement non- 
overlapping constraints [13] in Chorus3D so that we can use 
it for the collision resolution of graphical objects. Another 
future direction is to improve Chorus3D in the scalability 
and accuracy of constraint satisfaction.
