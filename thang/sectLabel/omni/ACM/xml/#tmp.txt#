ABSTRACT 
The main result of this paper is an explicit disperser for twoindependent sources on n bits, each of entropy k = no(1). Put differently, setting N = 2n and K = 2k, we construct explicit N × N Boolean matrices for which no K × K sub- matrix is monochromatic. Viewed as adjacency matrices of bipartite graphs, this gives an explicit construction of K- Ramsey bipartite graphs of size N. 
qThis greatly improves the previous bound of k = o(n) of Barak, Kindler, Shaltiel, Sudakov and Wigderson [4]. It also significantly improves the 25-year record of k = ~O(√n) on the special case of Ramsey graphs, due to Frankl and Wilson [9]. 
The construction uses (besides ”classical” extractor ideas) almost all of the machinery developed in the last couple of years for extraction from independent sources, including: 
• Bourgain’s extractor for 2 independent sources of some entropy rate &lt; 1/2 [5] 
• Raz’s extractor for 2 independent sources, one of which has any entropy rate &gt; 1/2 [18]

• Rao’s extractor for 2 independent block-sources of en-tropy no(1) [17] 
• The “Challenge-Response” mechanism for detecting “entropy concentration” of [4]. 
The main novelty comes in a bootstrap procedure which allows the Challenge-Response mechanism of [4] to be used with sources of less and less entropy, using recursive calls to itself. Subtleties arise since the success of this mecha- nism depends on restricting the given sources, and so re- cursion constantly changes the original sources. These are resolved via a new construct, in between a disperser and an extractor, which behaves like an extractor on sufficiently large subsources of the given ones.

1. INTRODUCTION 
This paper deals with randomness extraction from weak random sources. Here a weak random source is a distribu- tion which contains some entropy. The extraction task is to design efficient algorithms (called extractors) to convert this entropy into useful form, namely a sequence of independent unbiased bits. Beyond the obvious motivations (potential use of physical sources in pseudorandom generators and in derandomization), extractors have found applications in a
