Abstract
Proc. of the Int'l Symposium on High Performance
Computer Architecture (HPCA '95), pp. 200-209.
This paper presents a new approach to implement fast barrier synchronization in wormhole k-ary
n-cubes. The novelty lies in using multidestination
messages instead of the traditional single destination
messages. Two different multidestination worm types,
gather and broadcasting, are introduced to implement
the report and wake-up phases of barrier synchronization, respectively. Algorithms for complete and arbitrary set barrier synchronization are presented using
these new worms. It is shown that complete barrier
synchronization in a k-ary n-cube system with e-cube
routing can be implemented with 2n communication
start-ups as compared to 2n log 2 k start-ups needed
with unicast-based message passing. For arbitrary set
barrier, an interesting trend is observed where the synchronization cost keeps on reducing beyond a certain
number of participating nodes.

A Trip-based Multicasting Model in
Wormhole-routed Networks with Virtual Channels
//author
Yu-Chee Tseng , Dhabaleswar K. Panda , Member, IEEE, and Ten-Hwang Lai , Member, IEEE
//abstract
Abstract| This paper focuses on efficient multicasting in
wormhole-routed networks. A trip-based model is proposed
to support adaptive, distributed, and deadlock-free multiple
multicast on any network with arbitrary topology using at
most two virtual channels per physical channel. This model
significantly generalizes the path-based model proposed earlier [21], [22], which works only for Hamiltonian networks
and can not be applicable to networks with arbitrary topology resulted due to system faults. Fundamentals of the trip-based model, including the necessary and sufficient condition to be deadlock-free, and the use of appropriate number
of virtual channels to avoid deadlock are investigated. The
potential of this model is illustrated by applying it to hyper-cubes with faulty nodes. Simulation results indicate that the
proposed model can implement multiple multicast on faulty
hypercubes with negligible performance degradation.

Space Deformation using Ray Deectors

//abstract
Abstract
In this paper we introduce a new approach to the deformation of surface and raster
models in two and three dimensions. Rather then deforming the objects in the
model, we deform the rays used to render the scene. The mechanism to specify the
deformation, which we call a deector, is a vector of gravity positioned in space.
This gravity vector bends any ray that travels through its field of gravity. Images
generated by these curved rays give the impression of a deformed space. Unlike
previous methods that deform all the objects in the scene, our approach deforms
only those parts of the model that contribute to the final image. In addition, using
deectors, our approach can deform any object type that can be rendered by a ray
casting algorithm, providing a unified solution to space deformation.

Abstract
It has previously been shown that there exists a minimum degree ordering for regular grids that is considerably worse than nested dissection
in terms of fill-in and operations for factorization [1]. This paper proves
the existence of a minimum degree ordering for regular grids that has the
same optimal asymptotic order complexity for fill-in and operation count
as nested dissection. The analysis is verified by showing exact match between analytical prediction and experimental measurement. The analysis
motivates a peripheral preordering strategy for use with the popular multiple minimum degree (MMD) algorithm, and is shown to consistently
reduce fill-in and operation count for regular grids.

Abstract
Implicit curves are widely used in computer graphics because of their powerful features for modeling and their ability for general function description. The most popular rasterization techniques for implicit curves are space subdivision and curve
tracking. In this paper we are introducing an efficient curve tracking algorithm that
is also more robust then existing methods. We employ the Predictor-Corrector
Method on the implicit function to get a very accurate curve approximation in a
short time. Speedup is achieved by adapting the step size to the curvature. In addition, we provide mechanisms to detect and properly handle bifurcation points,
where the curve intersects itself. Finally, the algorithm allows the user to trade-off
accuracy for speed and vice a versa. We conclude by providing examples that dem-onstrate the capabilities of our algorithm.

Abstract
This paper identifies performance degradation in wormhole routed k-ary n-cube networks due
to limited number of router-to-processor consumption channels at each node. Many recent research
in wormhole routing have advocated the advantages of adaptive routing and virtual channel flow
control schemes to deliver better network performance. This paper indicates that the advantages
associated with these schemes can not be realized with limited consumption capacity. To alleviate
such performance bottleneck, a new network interface design using multiple consumption channels
is proposed. To match virtual multiplexing on network channels, we also propose each consumption
channel to support multiple virtual consumption channels. The impact of message arrival rate at
a node on the required number of consumption channel is studied analytically. It is shown that
wormhole networks with higher routing adaptivity, dimensionality, degree of hot-spot traffic, and
number of virtual lanes have to take advantage of multiple consumption channels to deliver better
performance. The interplay between system topology, routing algorithm, number of virtual lanes,
messaging overheads, and communication traffic is studied through simulation to derive the effective
number of consumption channels required in a system. Using the on-going technological trend, it is
shown that wormhole-routed systems can use up to 2-4 consumption channels per node to deliver
better system performance.

Abstract
ATM Forum specifies public key cryptography to be the default ATM authentication mechanism and directory services like X.509 to be the infrastructure for public
key distribution and certification. Authenticated signaling, widely acknowledged
as a necessary security feature of ATM network, requires the signaling message to
be authenticated with a digital signature signed by the private key of the calling
party. To verify the digital signature, the called party needs to obtain the public
key of the calling party and a proof of the calling party's ownership to that public
key. In X.509, the standard form of such a proof is a chain of public key certificates, called the certificate path between two parties. Certificate exchange protocol
(CEP), proposed by ATM Forum, requires that another bi-directional connection
be established between two parties to exchange public keys and certificate paths
before an authenticated connection can be set up, which is not an ideal approach.
We propose an algorithm which is embedded into ATM routing protocols to generate a certificate path inside a signaling message on-the-fly as the signaling message
travels through the ATM network. In this approach, all that a calling party needs
to know for authentication purpose is its own public key certificate and the ATM
network builds the rest of the certificate path for it. Related issues like distribution
of public key certificates and optimization of CA hierarchy are also addressed in
this paper.

Abstract
A neural network approach to the classic
inverted pendulum task is presented. This task is the
task of keeping a rigid pole, hinged to a cart and free
to fall in a plane, in a roughly vertical orientation by
moving the cart horizontally in the plane while keeping the cart within some maximum distance of its
starting position. This task constitutes a difficult control problem if the parameters of the cart-pole system
are not known precisely or are variable. It also forms
the basis of an even more complex control-learning
problem if the controller must learn the proper actions
for successfully balancing the pole given only the current state of the system and a failure signal when the
pole angle from the vertical becomes too great or the
cart exceeds one of the boundaries placed on its position.
The approach presented is demonstrated to
be effective for the real-time control of a small, self-contained mini-robot, specially outfitted for the task.
Origins and details of the learning scheme, specifics
of the mini-robot hardware, and results of actual
learning trials are presented.

Abstract
According to space-based theory, visual attention is limited to a local region in space
called the attentional field. Visual information within the attentional field is enhanced
for further processing while information outside is suppressed. There is evidence that
enhancement and suppression are achieved with dynamic weighting of network activity.
This paper discusses a neural network that generates the appropriate weights, called the
attentional spotlight, given the size and the position of the intended attentional field.
The network has three layers. A shunting feedback network serves as the output layer
and performs a critical task which cannot be accomplished by feedforward networks.

Abstract
The problem of concurrent mapping and localization has received considerable attention in the mobile robotics community. With few exceptions, existing approaches can largely be
grouped into two distinct paradigms: topological and metric.
This paper proposes a method that integrates both paradigms.
It poses the mapping problem as a statistical maximum likelihood problem, and devises an efficient algorithm for search
in likelihood space. Based on that, it presents an novel mapping algorithm that integrates two phases: a topological and a
metric mapping phase. The topological mapping phase solves a
global position alignment problem between potentially indistinguishable, significant places. The subsequent metric mapping
phase produces a fine-grained metric map of the environment
in floating-point resolution. Experimental results in cyclic environments of sizes up to 80 by 25 meters demonstrate the
appropriateness of this approach.

Abstract
This work presents a study of the applicability of a massively parallel computing paradigm
to Monte Carlo techniques for device simulation. A unique mapping of Monte Carlo to SIMD
fine-grained parallelism has been developed, decoupling the problem into separate computational domains. For MOSFET simulation, this novel mapping allows estimated speeds of
over 200,000 scatterings processed per second on a 65,536 processor Connection Machine,
nearly a factor of six over the fastest known to date.

Abstract
A simple polygon P is said to have a Hamilitonian Triangulation if it has a triangulation
whose dual graph contains a Hamiltonian path. Such triangulations are useful in fast
rendering engines in Computer Graphics. Arkin et al. [AHMS] observed that a polygon
has a Hamiltonian triangulation if and only if it is Discretely Straight Walkable, a concept
that is a discrete version of Straight Walkability concept as introduced by Icking and Klein
[IK]. Using this characterization, Arkin et al. also showed an algorithm to recognize such
polygons in time that is linear in the size of the visibility polygon of the given polygon P .
The size of the visbility polygon of P could be quadratic in the size of P and hence their
algorithm could be very inefficient even for nearly convex polygons.
We give a new characterization of polygons with Hamiltonian triangulations. We use
this characterization to present the following algorithms:
* An O(n log n)-time algorithm to recognize polygons with a Hamiltonian triangulation.
* An O(n log n)-time algorithm to construct such a triangulation.
* Given vertices p and q on a simple polygon, an O(n)-time algorithm to determine
whether the polygon is discretely straight walkable with respect to the two vertices.
* An O(n log n)-time algorithm to list out all pairs of points on a simple polygon with
respect to which the polygon is discretely straight walkable.

The V -cycle of the wavelet variation of the "Frequency decomposition multigrid method" of Hackbusch [Numer. Math., 56, pp.
229-245, 1989] is considered.
It is shown that its convergence speed is not affected by the presence of anisotropy provided that the corresponding coarse grid correction is damped sufficiently strong. Our analysis is based on properties
of wavelet packets which are supplied and proved.
Numerical approximations to the speed of convergence illustrate
the theoretical results.

ABSTRACT
This paper discusses several current attempts to use acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation for modeling
physical phenomena and the role that wavelet analysis is playing in these efforts. The first problem involves recent
application of wavelets to computational fluid dynamics. The second problem involves geophysical modeling of the
ocean floor, using acoustic waves, and wavelets have recently been shown to play an important role here already.
The third problem involves modeling of SAR radar images in the context of automatic target recognition efforts.
The fourth problem is global illumination in computer graphics, i.e., simulation of reflected and absorbed light
for everyday environments. The role of wavelets is more embryonic in these latter two areas, but there are some
common principles in all of these modeling efforts, and the methodology of wavelets seems well suited to certain
aspects of these problems.

Abstract
Computer security professionals and researchers do not have a history of sharing and analyzing computer
vulnerability information. Scientists and engineers from older or more established fields have long understood
that publicizing, analyzing, and learning from other people's mistakes is essential to the stepwise refinement
of complex systems. Computer scientists, however, have not followed suit. Programmers reinvent classical
programming mistakes, contributing to the reappearance of known vulnerabilities.
In the recent past, computer systems have come to be a part of critical systems that have a direct effect
on the safety and well-being of human beings and hence we must have lower tolerance for software failures.
In the dissertation I will attempt to show that computer vulnerability information presents important
regularities and these can be detected, and possibly visualized, providing important insight about the reason
of their prevalence and existence. The information derived from these observations could be used to improve on
all phases of the development of software systems, as could be in the design, development, debugging, testing
and maintenance of complex computer systems that must implement a set of policies defined by security
analysis.
A significant portion of the work that must be performed will concentrate on the development of classifications and taxonomies that will permit the visualization and analysis of computer vulnerability information.
I hope that these classifications and taxonomies applied to a collection of vulnerabilities will provide a set
of features whose analysis will show that there are clear statistical clusterings and patterns caused because
developers and programmers are not learning from each others mistakes. This analysis may be performed by
applying statistical analysis and knowledge discovery tools.

ABSTRACT
Many operating systems have long had pseudo-teletypes, inter-process
communication channels that provide terminal semantics on one end,
and a smart server program on the other. We describe an analogous
concept, pseudo-network drivers. One end of the driver appears to be
a real network device, with the appropriate interface and semantics;
data written to it goes to a program, however, rather than to a physical
medium. Using this and some auxiliary mechanisms, we present a
variety of applications, including system test, network monitoring,
dial-up TCP/IP, and ways to both improve and subvert network
security. Most notably, we show how pseudo-network devices can be
used to create virtual networks and to provide encrypted
communications capability. We describe two implementations, one
using a conventional driver for socket-based systems, and one using
stream pipes for System V.

Abstract
In 1972, Reynolds outlined a general method for eliminating functional arguments known as defunctionalization. The
idea underlying defunctionalization is encoding functional
values as first-order data, and then to realized the applications of the encoded function via an apply function. Although this process is simple enough, problems arise when
defunctionalization is used in a polymorphic language. In
such a language, a functional argument of a higher-order
function can take different type instances in different applications. As a consequence, its associated apply function can
be untypable in the soucre language. In the paper we present
a defunctionalization transformation which preserves typa-bility. Moreover, the transformation imposes no restriction
on functional arguments of recursive functions, and it handles functions as results as well as functions encapsulated in
constructors or tuples. The key to this success is the use
of type information in the defunctionalization transformation. Run-time characteristics are preserved by defunction-alization; hence, there is no performance improvement coming from the transformation itself. However closures need
not be implemented to compile the transformed program.
Since the defunctionalization is driven by type information,
it can also easily perform a specialization of higher-order
functions with respect to the values of their functional arguments, hence gaining a real run-time improvement of the
transformed program.

Abstract
Reactive systems respond to concurrent, possibly unsynchronized streams of input events. Programming
reactive systems is challenging without language support for event-triggered actions. It is even more
challenging to reason about reactive systems. This paper explores a new conceptual basis for applying
functional programming techniques to the design and formal verification of reactive systems. The
mathematical foundation for this approach is based upon signature coalgebras and derived proof rules
for coinduction. The concepts are illustrated with an example that has been used with the language
Esterel.

Abstract
We give a review of basic statistical and neural techniques for classification. Statistical techniques are based on the idea of estimating class-conditional likelihoods and using Bayes rule
to convert these to posterior class probabilities whereas neural techniques estimate directly the
posteriors. Statistical techniques include (i) Parametric (Gaussian) Bayes classifiers, (ii) Non-parametric kernel-based density estimators like k-nearest neighbor and Parzen windows, and
(iii) mixtures of (Gaussian) densities (a special case of which is the Learning Vector Quantization). As neural classifiers, we include simple perceptrons and multilayer perceptrons with
sigmoid and Gaussian hidden units. The neural and statistical techniques are quite similar in
many respects and many approaches have been discovered independently twice, once in 1960s
by statisticians and once in 1980s by the neural network researchers. One of the aims of this article is to make this link more apparent. We also discuss two, most popular, pattern recognition
applications: Optical character recognition and speech recognition. Though they seem different,
in many respects, the two applications are similar and in the past, almost the same techniques
have been applied for their implementation. We implement the well known statistical and neural
classification techniques for two datasets of these applications and compare them in terms of
generalization accuracy, memory requirement and learning time. We especially advise to take
into account statistics of the sample even if a neural classifier is to be used. The similarity
between statistical and neural techniques is greater than generally agreed and simple statistical
methods like k-NN perform generally quite well and much of the functionality of neural networks like distributed parallel computation can be obtained by such methods without requiring
complicated computation and precise error minimization procedures.

Abstract
We define a standard of effectiveness for a database calculus
relative to a query language. Effectiveness judges suitability
to serve as a processing framework for the query language,
and comprises aspects of coverage, manipulability and
efficient evaluation. We present the monoid calculus, and
argue its effectiveness for object-oriented query languages,
exemplified by OQL of ODMG-93. The monoid calculus
readily captures such features as multiple collection types,
aggregations, arbitrary composition of type constructors and
nested query expressions. We also show how to extend
the monoid calculus to deal with vectors and arrays in
more expressive ways than current query languages do, and
illustrate how it can handle identity and updates.

//abstract
Abstract. Continuation-passing style (CPS) is a good abstract representation to use
for compilation and optimization: it has a clean semantics and is easily manipulated.
We examine how CPS expresses the saving and restoring of registers in source-language
procedure calls. In most CPS-based compilers, the context of the calling procedure is
saved in a "continuation closure"|a single variable that is passed as an argument to the
function being called. This closure is a record containing bindings of all the free variables
of the continuation; that is, registers that hold values needed by the caller "after the call"
are written to memory in the closure, and fetched back after the call.
Consider the procedure-call mechanisms used by conventional compilers. In particular,
registers holding values needed after the call must be saved and later restored. The
responsibility for saving registers can lie with the caller (a "caller-saves" convention)
or with the called function ("callee-saves"). In practice, to optimize memory traffic,
compilers find it useful to have some caller-saves registers and some callee-saves.
"Conventional" CPS-based compilers that pass a pointer to a record containing all
the variables needed after the call (i.e., the continuation closure), are using a caller-saves
convention. We explain how to express callee-save registers in Continuation-Passing
Style, and give measurements showing the resulting improvement in execution time.

Abstract
We propose several new techniques for resource management in a replicated object server. By coordinating cache
and disk usage among the replicas, these techniques increase throughput and reduce fetch latency. Cache splitting
speeds up fetches by avoiding redundant cache entries, effectively increasing the cache size. Coordinated writing
coordinates disk writes to ensure that one replica is always
available to service fetches. We investigate the performance
of a replicated server using these techniques, and we present
simulation results showing that these techniques provide
substantial performance improvements across a variety of
workloads.

preprocessing-based approach for handling
numerical attributes. An empirical investigation tries to evaluate the viability of the

Abstract
This paper describes several of our experiences with a real-time scheduler. Using a robot control application program, we motivate the importance of supporting multiple schedulers within the same application
program. We demonstrate the utility of speculative task execution in dynamic real-time systems, and describe the implementation of a scheduler for performing speculative execution and recovery. We show that
existing real-time scheduler interfaces have scope for improvement, especially when scheduling latency must
be low and when multiple schedulers used by a single application must co-exist on a single processor. A new
scheduler interface is specified and its basic costs are evaluated experimentally. Preliminary measurements on
a KSR-1 machine are quoted. The measurements demonstrate how the execution times of temporal queries
may be reduced by use of access structures to scheduler data structures. Finally, there are several overheads
associated with speculative execution, and multiple schedulers in a single application. We consider the problem of on-line reconfiguration of the several overheads associated with the speculative-execution paradigm
for optimal performance in the face of these overheads. Initial performance measurements of the PORTS
scheduler indicate that it is possible to perform real-time scheduling with latencies approximating those of
proposed specialized scheduling co-processors.

Core Selection Methods for
Multicast Routing

GIT-CC-95/15
//abstract
Abstract
Multicast routing is an important topic of both theoretical and practical
interest. Some recently-proposed multicast routing algorithms involve the
designation of one or more network nodes as the "center" of the routing
tree for each multicast group address. The choice of this designated router
(which we refer to as the "core") influences the shape of the multicast routing
tree, and thus influences performance of the routing scheme. In this paper we
investigate the relationship between the choice of core and three performance
measures. Specifically, we compare various methods of selecting a core with
respect to their effect on bandwidth, delay, and traffic concentration. We
conclude that simple methods are adequate for widely distributed groups,
but that the addition of group information can be leveraged to improve
performance especially when the group is small or exhibits a high degree
of locality. We also conclude that core choice has a significant impact on
traffic concentration, in fact traffic concentration effects can be ameliorated
by appropriate core choice policies.

Interactive Model-Based Image Understanding
//author

//abstract
Abstract
This paper describes a general architecture for an interactive model-based vision system. A
human specifies a limited amount of information which establishes a context for autonomous interpretation of images. Object models are described by constraints specifying necessary geometrical
properties and relationships between objects. The use of constraints allows for flexible object in-stantiation. A user can indicate an object in a scene and this directs perceptual processing routines
as well as constraining future object instantiations. This interactive model-based concept has been
applied to the domain of vehicle tracking, and this paper concludes with several processing examples
from this domain.

Abstract
Using the Trellis human/computer interaction model as an implementation vehicle, we demonstrate
how to use concurrency-supporting hypertext to provide visual displays of the execution flows through
a parallel Lisp program. In addition to displays, the hypertext interface allows injection of control
flow into an otherwise functional computation, and therefore provides reader control over the order of
evaluation of expressions. The resulting system, termed Trellis, can be thought of as a concurrent control
flow browser for composing functional computations, providing a visual implementation of kernel-control
decomposition. The advantages of Trellis are ease of exploring program side effects; ease of debugging
parallel code; aid in teaching functional languages; and the ability to construct hypertext documents
that have parallel execution semantics and flexible browsing behaviors.

A SIMPLE APPROACH TO DISTRIBUTED POOLS

//abstract
Computer networks hold the potential to coordinate the activities of multiple machines so that their combined computational abilities can be applied to solving a single problem. Several methods have been developed over the years to
harness the power of networked systems for solving certain classes of problems. One such class of problems is the distributed producer/consumer problem, in which a set of producer processes supply items to a set of consumer processes. Each
of the processes involved resides on a different machine, with the machines being connected by a network and the processes communicating via message passing. The problem, then, is how to coordinate the activities of the producers and consumers so that an acceptable level of throughput can be maintained with a minimal amount of overhead. This paper
presents a simple solution to the distributed producer/consumer problem. This solution, which is based upon the notion of
a distributed pool, is described in detail and its performance analyzed. As the analysis shows, the distributed pools algorithm presented herein is a simple, efficient solution to the distributed producer/consumer problem, and is capable of better than 90% efficiency under common conditions. Its major failing is that it needs the production rates of the producers
to be reasonably similar.

Abstract
A new, efficient selection predicate indexing scheme for active database systems is introduced.
The selection predicate index proposed uses an interval index on an attribute of a relation or
object collection when one or more rule condition clauses are defined on that attribute. The
selection predicate index uses a new type of interval index called the interval skip list (IS-list).
The IS-list is designed to allow efficient retrieval of all intervals that overlap a point, while allowing
dynamic insertion and deletion of intervals. IS-list algorithms are described in detail. The IS-list
allows efficient on-line searches, insertions, and deletions, yet is much simpler to implement than
other comparable interval index data structures such as the priority search tree and balanced
interval binary search tree (IBS-tree). IS-lists require only one third as much code to implement
as balanced IBS-trees. The combination of simplicity, performance, and dynamic updateability
of the IS-list is unmatched by any other interval index data structure. This makes the IS-list a
good interval index structure for implementation in an active database predicate index.

Abstract
The role of the systems analyst in the implementation process has changed
dramatically in recent times because of changes to organisational boundaries, the
need to align IT with business objectives and the complexity of the systems now
required. Some organisations are finding themselves in a continually changing
environment and being involved in multi-organisational structures. Establishing
strategies and requirements for these organisations requires a new understanding
of the implementation process. Implementation is concerned with behavioural
phenomena since people are involved from the inception of the idea, as well as
being involved in the development process. They are also affected by the changes
which the new system brings to the organisation. The research is attempting to
understand the critical factors associated with the implementation process and
consequently develop an appropriate model.

Abstract
Two-way authentication methods are inefficient when used to authenticate multiple users who wish to communicate securely with each other. M-way, also called conference authentication, is designed to efficiently authenticate many users and distribute a secure common conference key. Unfortunately, few if any conference
authentication schemes have been developed and/or performance tested in a real distributed system. This report
attempts to rectify this problem. Specifically, it presents the performance of both a star and a ring-based conference authentication scheme that has been developed for the RHODOS distributed operating system. As with most
systems, RHODOS does not have any special hardware, thus, a software based solution is utilised. This report
also attempts to shed some light upon how viable and secure a conference authentication scheme would be when
used in a distributed system.

Abstract
The appearance of an object or a face changes continuously as the observer
moves through the environment or as a face changes expression or pose. Recognizing an object or a face despite these image changes is a challenging problem
for computer vision systems, yet we perform the task quickly and easily. This
simulation investigates the ability of an unsupervised learning mechanism to
acquire representations that are tolerant to such changes in the image. The
learning mechanism finds these representations by capturing temporal relationships between 2-D patterns. Previous models of temporal association learning
have used idealized input representations. The input to this model consists of
graylevel images of faces. A two-layer network learned face representations that
incorporated changes of pose up to 30 ffi . A second network learned representations that were independent of facial expression.

Abstract
The game of Go has a high branching factor that defeats the tree
search approach used in computer chess, and long-range spa-tiotemporal interactions that make position evaluation extremely
difficult. Development of conventional Go programs is hampered
by their knowledge-intensive nature. We demonstrate a viable
alternative by training networks to evaluate Go positions via temporal difference (TD) learning.
Our approach is based on network architectures that reflect the
spatial organization of both input and reinforcement signals on
the Go board, and training protocols that provide exposure to
competent (though unlabelled) play. These techniques yield far
better performance than undifferentiated networks trained by self-play alone. A network with less than 500 weights learned within
3,000 games of 9x9 Go a position evaluation function that enables
a primitive one-ply search to defeat a commercial Go program at
a low playing level.

Displaying 3D Images: Algorithms for
Single Image Random Dot Stereograms
//author
Harold W. Thimbleby , Stuart Inglis , and Ian H. Witten *
//abstract
Abstract
This paper describes how to generate a single image which, when viewed in the
appropriate way, appears to the brain as a 3D scene. The image is a stereogram composed
of seemingly random dots. A new, simple and symmetric algorithm for generating such
images from a solid model is given, along with the design parameters and their influence
on the display. The algorithm improves on previously-described ones in several ways: it
is symmetric and hence free from directional (right-to-left or left-to-right) bias, it corrects
a slight distortion in the rendering of depth, it removes hidden parts of surfaces, and it
also eliminates a type of artifact that we call an echo.
Random dot stereograms have one remaining problem: difficulty of initial viewing. If
a computer screen rather than paper is used for output, the problem can be ameliorated by
shimmering, or time-multiplexing of pixel values. We also describe a simple
computational technique for determining what is present in a stereogram so that, if
viewing is difficult, one can ascertain what to look for.

Constructing a Configurable Group RPC Service

Tucson, AZ 85721, USA
//abstract
Abstract
Current Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services implement a variety of semantics, with many of the differences
related to how communication and server failures are handled. The list increases even more when considering group
RPC, a variant of RPC often used for fault-tolerance where
an invocation is sent to a group of servers rather than one.
This paper presents an approach to constructing group
RPC in which a single configurable system is used to build
different variants of the service. The approach is based on
implementing each property as a separate software module
called a micro-protocol, and then configuring the micro-protocols needed to implement the desired service together
using a software framework based on the x-kernel. The
properties of point-to-point and group RPC are identified
and classified, and the general execution model described.
An example consisting of a modular implementation of a
group RPC service is given to illustrate the approach. Dependency issues that restrict configurability are also addressed.

Abstract
The NASA Numerical Propulsion System Simulation
(NPSS) project is exploring the use of computer simulation
to facilitate the design of new jet engines. Several key issues
raised in this research are being examined in an NPSS-related research project: zooming, monitoring and control,
and support for heterogeneity. The design of a simulation
executive that addresses each of these issues is described.
In this work, the strategy of zooming, which allows codes
that model at different levels of fidelity to be integrated
within a single simulation, is applied to the fan component
of a turbofan propulsion system. A prototype monitoring
and control system has been designed for this simulation to
support experimentation with expert system techniques for
active control of the simulation. An interconnection system
provides a transparent means of connecting the heterogeneous systems that comprise the prototype.

The task of information browsers is (1) to aid in navigating through a

manipulate this item once found. This document describes three experiments in constructing tools for information browsing: TkMan for UNIX
manual pages, NBT for files in a hierarchical file system, and FoSel for
bitmap fonts. Each exploits the large-scale natural organization of data
and the fine-grained structure of each datum with a graphical user interface to provide a powerful yet intuitive tool. The lessons learned in implementing the browsers point to general principles that should guide the
design of all information browsers.

ABSTRACT
This paper evaluates several hardware platforms and operating systems using a set of benchmarks

overall conclusion is that operating system performance is not improving at the same rate as the
base speed of the underlying hardware. The most obvious ways to remedy this situation are to
improve memory bandwidth and reduce operating systems' tendency to wait for disk operations to
complete.

Abstract
In artificial evolution individuals which perform as their parents are usually rewarded identically
to their parents. We note that Nature is more dynamic and there may be a penalty to pay for doing
the same thing as your parents. We report two sets of experiments where static fitness functions
are firstly augmented by a penalty for unchanged offspring and secondly the static fitness case
is replaced by randomly generated dynamic test cases. We conclude genetic programming, when
evolving artificial ant control programs, is surprisingly little effected by large penalties and program
growth is observed in all our experiments.

Abstract
The problem of programming an artificial ant to follow the Santa Fe trail is used as an example
program search space. Analysis of shorter solutions shows they have many of the characteristics
often ascribed to manually coded programs. Enumeration of a small fraction of the total search
space and random sampling characterise it as rugged with many multiple plateaus split by deep
valleys and many local and global optima. This suggests it is difficult for hill climbing algorithms.
Analysis of the program search space in terms of fixed length schema suggests it is highly deceptive
and that for the simplest solutions large building blocks must be assembled before they have above
average fitness. In some cases we show solutions cannot be assembled using a fixed representation
from small building blocks of above average fitness. These suggest the Ant problem is difficult for
Genetic Algorithms.
Random sampling of the program search space suggests on average the density of global optima
changes only slowly with program size but the density of neutral networks linking points of the same
fitness grows approximately linearly with program length. This is part of the cause of bloat.
Previously reported genetic programming, simulated annealing and hill climbing performance is
shown not to be much better than random search on the Ant problem.

Abstract
In this paper we present the GP-Music System, an interactive system which allows users to evolve short musical sequences
using interactive genetic programming, and its extensions aimed at making the system fully automated. The basic GP-system works by using a genetic programming algorithm, a small set of functions for creating musical sequences, and a user
interface which allows the user to rate individual sequences. With this user interactive technique it was possible to generate
pleasant tunes over runs of 20 individuals over 10 generations. As the user is the bottleneck in interactive systems, the
system takes rating data from a users run and uses it to train a neural network based automatic rater, or auto rater, which
can replace the user in bigger runs. Using this auto rater we were able to make runs of up to 50 generations with 500
individuals per generation. The best of run pieces generated by the auto raters were pleasant but were not, in general, as
nice as those generated in user interactive runs.

Abstract
We introduce the concept of energy per operation as
a measure of performance of an asynchronous circuit.
We show how to model energy consumption based on
the high-level language specification. This model is independent of voltage and timing considerations. We
apply this model to memory design. We show first
how to dimension a memory array, and how to break
up this memory array into smaller arrays to minimize
the energy per access. We then show how to use cache
memory and pre-fetch mechanisms to further reduce
energy per access.

Abstract. A critical challenge faced by the developer of a software system is to understand whether the system's components correctly integrate. While type theory has provided substantial help in detecting and
preventing errors in mismatched static properties, much work remains
in the area of dynamics. In particular, components make assumptions
about their behavioral interaction with other components, but currently
we have only limited ways in which to state those assumptions and to
analyze those assumptions for correctness.
We have begun to formulate a method that addresses this problem. The
method operates at the architectural level so that behavioral integration
errors, such as deadlock, can be revealed early in development. For each
component, a specification is given both of its own interaction behavior
and of the assumptions that it makes about the interaction behavior of
the external context in which it expects to operate. We have defined an
algorithm that, given such specifications for a set of components, performs "adequacy" checks between the component context assumptions
and the component interaction behaviors. A configuration of a system is
possible if and only if a successful way of "matching" actual behaviors
with assumptions can be found. In effect, we are extending the usual no
tion of type checking to include the checking of behavioral compatibility.

Abstract
This paper presents a method that can be used for
the elicitation and specification of requirements and
high-level design. It supports stakeholder-based modeling, rapid feasibility feedback to marketing, and the
interpersonal dynamics that are necessary to develop
a product. The method centers on the role of the facilitator, an independent agent whose purpose is to build
the Integrated System Model (ISM). The ISM is the result of merging the independent system views from all
stakeholders at any given abstraction level. Formulation of this method was based on the real-world experience of developing a complex, high-technology medical
product with critical time-to-market pressures. It has
proven to be a practical approach to the evolution of
requirements definition and provides a necessary link
to the marketing aspect of a product.

Abstract
Software distribution is evolving from a physical media
approach to one where it is practical and advantageous to
leverage the connectivity of networks. Network distribution of software systems provides timeliness and continuity
of evolution not possible with physical media distribution
methods. To support network-based software distribution,
companies and organizations such as Microsoft, Marimba,
and the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF) are
strengthening their efforts to package software systems in
a way that is conducive to network distribution and management. The result of these efforts has led to the creation
of software description languages and schema such as the
Open Software Description format created by Microsoft and
Marimba and the Management Information Format created
by DMTF. While these efforts are steps in the right direction, they do not address deployment issues in a complete
and systematic fashion. The contribution of this paper is to
evaluate these leading software description technologies.

Global Optimization Methods for Protein Folding Problems

Schnabel , Chung-Shang Shao , and Zhihong Zou
//abstract
Abstract. The problem of finding the naturally occurring structure of a protein is believed to correspond to minimizing the free, or potential, energy of
the protein. This is generally a very difficult global optimization problem, with
a large number of parameters and a huge number of local minimizers including many with function values near that of the global minimizer. This paper
presents a new global optimization method for such problems. The method
consists of an initial phase that locates some reasonably low local minimizers of
the energy function, followed by the main phase that progresses from the best
current local minimizers to even lower local minimizers. The method combines
portions that work on small subsets of the parameters, including small-scale
global optimizations using stochastic methods, with local minimizations involving all the parameters. In computational tests on the protein polyalanine
with up to 58 amino acids (116 internal parameters), the method appears to
be very successful in finding the lowest energy structures. The largest case
is particularly significant because the lowest energy structures that are found
include ones that exhibit interesting tertiary as opposed to just secondary
structure.

Abstract
In this paper we propose a new framework for
studying Markov decision processes (MDPs),
based on ideas from statistical mechanics. The
goal of learning in MDPs is to find a policy
that yields the maximum expected return over
time. In choosing policies, agents must therefore weigh the prospects of short-term versus
long-term gains. We study a simple MDP in
which the agent must constantly decide between exploratory jumps and local reward mining in state space. The number of policies to
choose from grows exponentially with the size
of the state space, N . We view the expected returns as defining an energy landscape over policy space. Methods from statistical mechanics
are used to analyze this landscape in the thermodynamic limit N ! 1. We calculate the
overall distribution of expected returns, as well
as the distribution of returns for policies at a
fixed Hamming distance from the optimal one.
We briefly discuss the problem of learning optimal policies from empirical estimates of the
expected return. As a first step, we relate our
findings for the entropy to the limit of high-temperature learning. Numerical simulations
support the theoretical results.

//abstract
Abstract
I present a modular network architecture and a learning algorithm based
on incremental dynamic programming that allows a single learning agent
to learn to solve multiple Markovian decision tasks (MDTs) with significant transfer of learning across the tasks. I consider a class of MDTs,
called composite tasks, formed by temporally concatenating a number of
simpler, elemental MDTs. The architecture is trained on a set of composite and elemental MDTs. The temporal structure of a composite task is
assumed to be unknown and the architecture learns to produce a temporal decomposition. It is shown that under certain conditions the solution
of a composite MDT can be constructed by computationally inexpensive
modifications of the solutions of its constituent elemental MDTs.

//abstract
Abstract
A novel approach to constant-magnification imaging is proposed. Magnification variations due to
changes in focus setting pose problems for important
vision techniques, such as, depth from defocus. It
is shown that magnification of a conventional lens
can be made invariant to defocus by simply adding
an aperture at an analytically derived location. The
resulting optical configuration is called "telecentric."
It is shown that most commercially available lenses
can be turned into telecentric ones. The procedure
for calculating the position of the additional aperture
and a detailed analysis of the photometric and geometric properties of telecentric lenses are discussed.
The magnification invariance of telecentric optics and
its application to the problem of depth from defocus
are experimentally demonstrated in [ Watanabe and
Nayar-1995 ] . The proposed optics was found to result in significantly improved depth maps than those
obtained using a conventional lens.

Abstract
There is increasing interest in the recovery of generalized cylinders (GCs) with curved spines. However,
existing formulations of such GCs, for example those
based on the Frenet-Serret frame or the tube model,
suffer serious drawbacks: discontinuities, a lack of expressive power, "narrowing" in the plane normal to
the spine, non-intuitive twisting behavior, and/or off-axis nonorthogonality of their local coordinate systems.
We discuss some of the problems associated with the
non-orthogonality of the coordinate system based on
the Frenet-Serret frame. This non-orthogonality is induced by torsion effects and we show how to correct for
it. We then introduce a new model, the extruded GC
(EGC) model, which overcomes all the problems mentioned above. For complex axes, the EGC model is also
simpler to understand and use than existing models.
The EGC model is further extended by including local surface deformations. Recovery of the deformable
EGC via a physically-motivated paradigm is demonstrated on pre-segmented data from a human carotid
artery.

Abstract. Let F be a class of functions defined on a d-dimensional domain. Our task is
to compute H m -norm "-approximations to solutions of 2mth-order elliptic boundary-value
problems Lu = f for a fixed L and for f 2 F . We assume that the only information we
can compute about f 2 F is the value of a finite number of continuous linear functionals
of f, each evaluation having cost c(d). Previous work has assumed that F was the unit
ball of a Sobolev space H r of fixed smoothness r, and it was found that the complexity of
computing an "-approximation was comp("; d) = fi(c(d)(1=") d=(r+m) ). Since the exponent
of 1=" depends on d, we see that the problem is intractable in 1=" for any such F of fixed
smoothness r. In this paper, we ask whether we can break intractability by letting F be the
unit ball of a space of infinite smoothness. To be specific, we let F be the unit ball of a
Hardy space of analytic functions defined over a complex d-dimensional ball of radius greater
than one. We then show that the problem is tractable in 1=". More precisely, we prove that
comp("; d) = fi(c(d)(ln 1=") d ), where the fi-constant depends on d. Since for any p &gt; 0, there
is a function K() such that comp("; d) c(d)K(d)(1=") p for sufficiently small ", we see that
the problem is tractable, with (minimal) exponent 0. Furthermore, we show how to construct
a finite element p-method (in the sense of Babuska) that can compute an "-approximation
with cost fi(c(d)(ln 1=") d ). Hence this finite element method is a nearly optimal complexity
algorithm for d-dimensional elliptic problems with analytic data.

Abstract
Expert Databases are environments that support the processing of rule programs against a disk resident database.
They occupy a position intermediate between active and deductive databases, with respect to the level of abstraction
of the underlying rule language. The operational semantics
of the rule language influences the problem solving strategy,
while the architecture of the processing environment determines efficiency and scalability.
In this paper, we present elements of the PARADISER
architecture and its kernel rule language, PARULEL. The
PARADISER environment provides support for parallel and
distributed evaluation of rule programs, as well as static
and dynamic load balancing protocols that predictively
balance a computation at runtime. This combination of
features results in a scalable database rule and complex
query processing architecture. We validate our claims by
analyzing the performance of the system for two realistic
test cases. In particular, we show how the performance of a
parallel implementation of transitive closure is significantly
improved by predictive dynamic load balancing.

Abstract
We present a multi-dimensional database model,
which we believe can serve as a conceptual model
for On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP)-based
applications. Apart from providing the functionalities necessary for OLAP-based applications, the
main feature of the model we propose is a clear
separation between structural aspects and the contents. This separation of concerns allows us to define data manipulation languages in a reasonably
simple, transparent way. In particular, we show
that the data cube operator can be expressed easily. Concretely, we define an algebra and a calculus
and show them to be equivalent. We conclude by
comparing our approach to related work.
The conceptual multi-dimensional database model
developed here is orthogonal to its implementa
tion, which is not a subject of the present paper.

Abstract
We consider the family of lines that are area bisectors of a polygon (possibly with
holes) in the plane. We say that two bisectors of a polygon P are combinatorially
distinct if they induce different partitionings of the vertices of P . We derive an algebraic
characterization of area bisectors. We then show that there are simple polygons with n
vertices that have (n 2 ) combinatorially distinct area bisectors (matching the obvious
upper bound), and present an output-sensitive algorithm for computing an explicit
representation of all the bisectors of a given polygon. Our study is motivated by the
development of novel, flexible feeding devices for parts positioning and orienting. The
question of determining all the bisectors of polygonal parts arises in connection with
the development of efficient part positioning strategies when using these devices.

Asymptotically Tight Bounds for Performing
BMMC Permutations on Parallel Disk Systems

//abstract
Abstract
We give asymptotically equal lower and upper bounds for the number of parallel I/O operations required to perform bit-matrix-multiply/complement (BMMC) permutations on parallel
disk systems. In a BMMC permutation on N records, where N is a power of 2, each (lg N )-bit
source address x maps to a corresponding (lg N)-bit target address by the matrix equation
= A x c, where matrix multiplication is performed over GF (2). The characteristic matrix A
is (lg N )fi(lg N ) and nonsingular over GF (2). Under the Vitter-Shriver parallel-disk model with
N records, D disks, B records per block, and M records of memory, we show a universal lower
bound of
BD
1 + rank
lg(M=B)
parallel I/Os for performing a BMMC permutation, where
is the lower left lg(N=B) fi lg B submatrix of the characteristic matrix. We also present an algo
rithm that uses at most 2N
BD
rank
lg(M=B)
+ 2
parallel I/Os, which asymptotically matches the
lower bound and improves upon the BMMC and bit-permute/complement (BPC) algorithms in
[4]. When rank is low, this method is an improvement over the general-permutation bound of
fi
N
lg(N=B)
We introduce a new subclass of BMMC permutations, called memoryload-dispersal (MLD)
permutations, which can be performed in one pass. This subclass, which is used in the BMMC
algorithm, extends the catalog of one-pass permutations appearing in [4].
Although many BMMC permutations of practical interest fall into subclasses that might be
explicitly invoked within the source code, we show how to detect in at most N=BD+
l
D
parallel I/Os whether a given vector of target addresses specifies a BMMC permutation. Thus,
one can determine efficiently at run time whether a permutation to be performed is BMMC and
then avoid the general-permutation algorithm and save parallel I/Os by using our algorithm.

Abstract
In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in the amount of
information available to our society. In particular, the amount of
information available online through vast networks like the global
Internet has been growing at a staggering rate. This growth rate has by far
exceeded the rate of growth in network speeds, as has the number of
individuals and organizations seeking access to this information. There is
thus a motivation to find abstract methods of manipulating this online
data in ways that both serve the needs of end users efficiently and use
network resources intelligently. In lieu of a traditional clientserver model
of information processing, which is both inflexible and potentially very
inefficient, a Transportable Intelligent Agent system has the potential to
achieve a more efficient and flexible network system. An intelligent agent
is a program that models the information space for a user, and allows the
user to specify how the information is to be processed. A transportable
agent can suspend its execution, transport itself to a new location on a
network, and resume execution at the new location. This is a particularly
attractive model for both wireless and dialup networks where a user might
not be able to maintain a permanent network connection, as well as for
situations where the amount of information to be processed is large
relative to the network bandwidth. Preliminary work in the field has
shown that such agent systems are possible and deserve further study.
This thesis describes a prototype transportable intelligent agent system that
extends work already done in the field. Agents are written in a modified
version of the Tcl programming language and transported using TCP/IP
connections. Several simple examples demonstrate the properties of the
system.

//abstract
Most current multiprocessor file systems are designed to use multiple disks
in parallel, using the high aggregate bandwidth to meet the growing I/O
requirements of parallel scientific applications. Many multiprocessor file
systems provide applications with a conventional Unix-like interface, allowing the application to access multiple disks transparently. This interface conceals the parallelism within the file system, increasing the ease
of programmability, but making it difficult or impossible for sophisticated programmers and libraries to use knowledge about their I/O needs
to exploit that parallelism. In addition to providing an insufficient interface, most current multiprocessor file systems are optimized for a different
workload than they are being asked to support. We introduce Galley, a
new parallel file system that is intended to efficiently support realistic
scientific multiprocessor workloads. We discuss Galley's file structure and
application interface, as well as the performance advantages offered by
that interface.

Abstract
This paper presents a new atomic commitment protocol, enhanced three phase commit
(E3PC ), that always allows a quorum in the system to make progress. Previously suggested
quorum-based protocols (e.g., the quorum-based three phase commit (3PC) [Ske82]) allow a
quorum to make progress in case of one failure. If failures cascade, however, and the quorum
in the system is "lost" (i.e., at a given time no quorum component exists), a quorum can later
become connected and still remain blocked. With our protocol, a connected quorum never
blocks. E3PC is based on the quorum-based 3PC [Ske82], and it does not require more time
or communication than 3PC. We describe how this protocol can be exploited in a replicated
database setting, making the database always available to a majority of the sites.

Relating Comprehension and Production

//abstract
Abstract
Most theories of language processing and acquisition make the assumption that
perception and comprehension are related to production, but few have anything say
about how. This paper describes a performance-oriented connectionist model of
the acquisition of morphology in which production builds on representations which
develop during the learning of word recognition. Using artificial language stimuli
embodying simple suffixation, prefixation, and template rules, I demonstrate that
the model generalizes to novel combinations of roots and inflections for both word
recognition and production. I argue that the capacity of connectionist networks to
develop intermediate distributed representations which not only enable the solving
of the task at hand but also facilitate another task offers a plausible account of how
comprehension and production come to share phonological knowledge as words are
learned.

Abstract
Most data models and query languages, provide mechanisms for dealing with sets
of objects. Many applications nowadays, however, are list-oriented, i.e., deal with
collections or aggregates of objects in which their order is important. A formal model
and an algebra for representing and manipulating list-oriented data are presented in
this paper. We also give the criteria that were used in the design of the algebra and
show how the algebra satisfies these criteria.

Abstract
Data- and task-parallelism are two important parallel programming models. Object-oriented paradigm
in parallelism provides a good way of abstracting out various aspects of computations and computing resources. Using an object-oriented language like C++, one can compose data and control representations
into a single active object.
We propose a thread model of parallelism that addresses both data and task parallelism. Computation
and communication can be overlapped by suspending a thread of computation which is waiting for an
event and running an eligible thread of computation in its place. Threads naturally subsume task-parallelism. Threads are encapsulated into thread objects may be grouped into rope objects [22, 20], that
span the parallel machine domain, for collective computation and communication. Thus data-parallelism
can be supported. Since rope objects are parallel objects, they can be customized, interestingly, in a
serial or a parallel manner. Spatial transparency of objects is achieved by global pointer templates.
We present results from a prototype system running on the SGI Challenge and the Intel Paragon.

Abstract
This paper proposes a framework for predicate detection in systems of processes with approximately-synchronized real-time clocks. Timestamps from these clocks are used to define two orderings on
events: "definitely occurred before" and "possibly occurred before". These orderings lead naturally
to definitions of 3 distinct detection modalities, i.e., 3 meanings of "predicate held during a computation", namely: Poss T (" possibly held"), Def T (" definitely held"), and Inst ("
definitely held at a specific instant"). This paper defines these modalities and gives efficient algorithms for detecting them; the algorithms are based on algorithms of Cooper and Marzullo, Garg
and Waldecker, and Fromentin and Raynal.

Finding Genes in DNA with a Hidden Markov Model

//abstract
Abstract
This study describes a new Hidden Markov Model (HMM) system for segmenting uncharacterized genomic DNA sequences into exons, introns, and intergenic
regions. Separate HMM modules were designed and trained for specific regions of
DNA: exons, introns, intergenic regions, and splice sites. The models were then
tied together to form a biologically feasible topology. The integrated HMM was
trained further on a set of eukaryotic DNA sequences, and tested by using it to
segment a separate set of sequences. The resulting HMM system, which is called
VEIL (Viterbi Exon-Intron Locator), obtains an overall accuracy on test data of
92% of total bases correctly labelled, with a correlation coefficient of 0.68. Using the more stringent test of exact exon prediction, VEIL correctly located both
ends of 46% of the exons. Moreover, more than 50% of the exons it predicts are
exactly correct. These results compare favorably to the best previous results for
gene structure prediction, and demonstrate the benefits of using HMMs for this
problem.

Abstract
For succesful information systems development, conceptual data modelling is essential.
Nowadays many techniques for conceptual data modelling exist, examples are NIAM, FORM,
PSM, many (E)ER variants, IFO, and FDM. In-depth comparisons of concepts of these techniques is very difficult as the mathematical formalisations of these techniques, if existing at
all, are very different. As such there is a need for a unifying formal framework providing a
sufficiently high level of abstraction. In this paper the use of category theory for this purpose
is addressed. Well-known conceptual data modelling concepts are discussed from a category
theoretic point of view. Advantages and disadvantages of the approach chosen will be outlined.

Abstract
In this paper we present results of experiments carried out with a route learning system for a
mobile robot, conducted in a `real world' environment covering distances of several hundred metres.
The system uses no odometry and is based on a self-organising mapbuilding process using perceptual
landmarks.
A performance metric is defined and used to measure the robot's ability to traverse the route.

Abstract
It is argued that the following three properties are foundations of robust robot
navigation:
* The use of landmarks (and, in particular, the use of a compass sense),
* the use of canonical paths, and
* the use of topological rather than geometrical maps.
Some examples of successful animal navigation are presented that support this view.
We have performed initial experiments with mobile robots to investigate mechanisms
suitable to implement such navigational architectures. Experiments concerning navigation by dead reckoning are presented, and a differential light compass is introduced
to aid robot navigation.

Error-Correcting Output Codes:
A General Method for Improving

//abstract
Abstract
Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a
discrete set containing k &gt; 2 values (i.e., k "classes").
The definition is acquired by studying large collections
of training examples of the form hx i ; f(x i )i. Existing
approaches to this problem include (a) direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree
algorithms ID3 and CART, (b) application of binary
concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary
functions for each of the k classes, and (c) application
of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed
output codes such as those employed by Sejnowski and
Rosenberg in the NETtalk system. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in
which BCH error-correcting codes are employed as a
distributed output representation. We show that these
output representations improve the performance of ID3
on the NETtalk task and of backpropagation on an
isolated-letter speech-recognition task. These results
demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass
problems.

//abstract
Abstract
A new set of tools for verifying smoothness of surfaces generated by stationary
subdivision algorithms is presented. The main challenge here is the verification of
injectivity of the characteristic map. The tools are sufficiently versatile and easy
to wield to allow, as an application, a full analysis of algorithms generalizing bi-quadratic and bicubic B-spline subdivision. In the case of generalized biquadratic
subdivision the analysis yields a hitherto unknown sharp bound strictly less than
one on the second largest eigenvalue of any smoothly converging subdivision.

Abstract
This paper describes the performance evaluation of six temporal reasoning systems.
We show that if you are working with large temporal datasets where information
is added incrementally throughout the execution of the program, systems using incompletely connected graphs (i.e., TMM, TimeGraph and TimeGraph-II) seem the
best option. While they do not offer the constant query time of systems using fully
connected graphs (i.e. the systems based on constraint satisfaction), the savings at
assertion time are so substantial that the relatively small performance penalty for
queries is a reasonable tradeoff. Of course, these systems do not offer the expressiv
ity of the interval-based systems as they only handle point-based relations. Of the
three, TimeGraph-II offers a wider range of qualitative relations as it handles point
inequality. It does not currently handle metric information, however, as do TMM
and TimeGraph. Thus decisions between these three may be more determined by the
reasoning capabilities required rather than raw performance.

Utterance Units in Spoken Dialogue
//author
David R. Traum 1 and Peter A. Heeman 2
//abstract
Abstract. In order to make spoken dialogue systems more sophisticated, designers need to better understand the conventions that people
use in structuring their speech and in interacting with their fellow con-versants. In particular, it is crucial to discriminate the basic building
blocks of dialogue and how they affect the way people process language. Many researchers have proposed the utterance unit as the
primary object of study, but defining exactly what this is has remained a difficult issue. To shed light on this question, we consider
grounding behavior in dialogue, and examine co-occurrences between
turn-initial grounding acts and utterance unit signals that have been
proposed in the literal, namely prosodic boundary tones and pauses.
Preliminary results indicate high correlation between grounding and
boundary tones, with a secondary correlation for longer pauses. We
also consider some of the dialogue processing issues which are impacted by a definition of utterance unit.

Abstract
Our research addresses the general topic of atomic update of shared data
structures on large-scale shared-memory multiprocessors. In this paper
we consider alternative implementations of the general-purpose single-address atomic primitives fetch and , compare and swap, load linked,
and store conditional. These primitives have proven popular on small-scale bus-based machines, but have yet to become widely available on
large-scale, distributed shared memory machines. We propose several alternative hardware implementations of these primitives, and then analyze
the performance of these implementations for various data sharing patterns. Our results indicate that good overall performance can be obtained
by implementing compare and swap in the cache controllers, and by pro
viding an additional instruction to load an exclusive copy of a cache line.

THE COMPLEXITY OF COMPUTING
MAXIMAL WORD FUNCTIONS
//author
Eric Allender , Danilo Bruschi
and Giovanni Pighizzini
//abstract
Abstract. Maximal word functions occur in data retrieval applications
and have connections with ranking problems, which in turn were first
investigated in relation to data compression [21]. By the "maximal word
function" of a language L , we mean the problem of finding, on
input x, the lexicographically largest word belonging to L that is smaller
than or equal to x.
In this paper we present a parallel algorithm for computing maximal
word functions for languages recognized by one-way nondeterministic
auxiliary pushdown automata (and hence for the class of context-free
languages).
This paper is a continuation of a stream of research focusing on the
problem of identifying properties others than membership which are
easily computable for certain classes of languages. For a survey, see [24].

Abstract
Bayesian inference begins with a prior distribution for model parameters that is
meant to capture prior beliefs about the relationship being modeled. For multilayer
perceptron networks, where the parameters are the connection weights, the prior
lacks any direct meaning | what matters is the prior over functions computed
by the network that is implied by this prior over weights. In this paper, I show
that priors over weights can be defined in such a way that the corresponding
priors over functions reach reasonable limits as the number of hidden units in the
network goes to infinity. When using such priors, there is thus no need to limit the
size of the network in order to avoid "overfitting". The infinite network limit also
provides insight into the properties of different priors. A Gaussian prior for hidden-to-output weights results in a Gaussian process prior for functions, which can be
smooth, Brownian, or fractional Brownian, depending on the hidden unit activation
function and the prior for input-to-hidden weights. Quite different effects can be
obtained using priors based on non-Gaussian stable distributions. In networks with
more than one hidden layer, a combination of Gaussian and non-Gaussian priors
appears most interesting.

bottom-up, top-down and lateral connections to perform Bayesian perceptual inference correctly. Once perceptual inference has been performed the connection strengths can be updated
using a very simple learning rule that only requires locally available information. We demon
strate that the network learns to extract sparse, distributed, hierarchical representations.

Abstract
We first describe a hierarchical, generative model that can be
viewed as a non-linear generalisation of factor analysis and can
be implemented in a neural network. The model performs perceptual inference in a probabilistically consistent manner by using
top-down, bottom-up and lateral connections. These connections
can be learned using simple rules that require only locally available information. We then show how to incorporate lateral connections into the generative model. The model extracts a sparse,
distributed, hierarchical representation of depth from simplified
random-dot stereograms and the localised disparity detectors in
the first hidden layer form a topographic map. When presented
with image patches from natural scenes, the model develops topo
graphically organised local feature detectors.

Maya is a simulation platform for evaluating the performance of parallel programs on parallel architectures with different memory coherence protocols. Rapid prototyping of different memory protocols
supporting varying degrees of coherence is possible and the impact of these protocols on the performance
of application programs can be studied. Implementations of existing weak memories along with some
new primitives using Maya are presented. The results of running some user applications are summarized

Abstract
Multi-armed bandits may be viewed as
decompositionally-structured Markov decision processes (MDP's) with potentially very-large state sets. A particularly elegant
methodology for computing optimal policies
was developed over twenty ago by Gittins
[Gittins & Jones, 1974]. Gittins' approach
reduces the problem of finding optimal policies for the original MDP to a sequence of
low-dimensional stopping problems whose solutions determine the optimal policy through
the so-called "Gittins indices." Katehakis
and Veinott [Katehakis & Veinott, 1987] have
shown that the Gittins index for a process
in state i may be interpreted as a particular
component of the maximum-value function
associated with the "restart-in-i" process,
a simple MDP to which standard solution
methods for computing optimal policies, such
as successive approximation, apply. This paper explores the problem of learning the Git-tins indices on-line without the aid of a process model; it suggests utilizing process-state-specific Q-learning agents to solve their respective restart-in-state-i subproblems, and
includes an example in which the online reinforcement learning approach is applied to
a problem of stochastic scheduling|one instance drawn from a wide class of problems
that may be formulated as bandit problems.

Abstract
Tracking and evaluating the progress of large, complex plans or
schedules as they unfold in real time is extremely difficult for humans.
In this paper we present a mixed-initiative system for the task of schedule maintenance in a simulated shipping network. A schedule maintenance agent monitors the network, predicting the occurrence of states
that may result in reduced throughput and formulating schedule modifications to avoid those states. The goal is to maximize throughput
while minimizing disruptions to the original schedule. We present results of experiments in which human subjects attempt to obtain that
goal both with and without the aid of the agent. We found that the human and the agent working together are able to achieve better results
than either one working alone. In addition to looking at global performance measures such as throughput, we analyze individual schedule
modification decisions made by subjects in an attempt to assign credit
for the improvements in performance.

Abstract
Design-to-time is an approach to problem-solving in resource-constrained domains where:
multiple solution methods are available for tasks, those solution methods make tradeoffs in
solution quality versus time, and satisficing solutions are acceptable. Design-to-time involves
designing a solution to a problem that uses all available resources to maximize the solution
quality within the available time. This paper defines the design-to-time approach in detail,
contrasting it to the anytime algorithm approach, and presents a heuristic algorithm for design-to-time real-time scheduling.
Our blackboard architecture that implements the design-to-time approach is discussed and
an example problem and solution from the Distributed Vehicle Monitoring Testbed (DVMT) is
described in detail. Experimental results, generated using a simulation, show the effects of
various parameters on scheduler performance. Finally we discuss future research goals and
plans.

Design-to-time real-time scheduling is an alternative to the many flexible computation approaches that are based on anytime algorithms.
It builds schedules at runtime that dynamically
combine solutions to subproblems, taking advantage of the time available to achieve the best
results it can. In this paper we look in detail at
a few issues related to design-to-time, including where the approximations we rely on come

Abstract
We present a new approach that enables compiler
optimization of procedure calls and loop nests containing procedure calls. We introduce two inter-procedural transformations that move loops across procedure boundaries, exposing them to traditional optimizations on loop nests. These transformations are
incorporated into a code generation algorithm for a
shared-memory multiprocessor. The code generator relies on a machine model to estimate the expected benefits of loop parallelization and parallelism-enhancing
transformations. Several transformation strategies are
explored and one that minimizes total execution time is
selected. Efficient support of this strategy is provided
by an existing interprocedural compilation system. We
demonstrate the potential of these techniques by applying this code generation strategy to two scientific
applications programs.

for such a paradigm arises in signal understanding domains that require the processing of
complicated interacting signals under variable signal-to-noise ratios. One such application is
sound understanding, in the context of which we report on a testbed experiment illustrating

Abstract
The availability of low-cost computational power is a driving force behind the growing sophistication
of CAD software. Tools designed to reduce time-consuming build-test-redesign iterations are essential
for increasing engineering quality and productivity. However, automation of the design process poses
many difficult computational problems. As more downstream engineering activities are being considered
during the design phase, guaranteeing reasonable response times within design systems becomes problematic. Design is an interactive process and speed is a critical factor in systems that enable designers to
explore and experiment with alternative ideas during the design phase. Achieving interactivity requires
an increasingly sophisticated allocation of computational resources in order to perform realistic design
analyses and generate feedback in real time.
This paper presents our initial efforts to develop techniques to apply distributed algorithms to the
problem of recognizing machining features from solid models. Existing work on recognition of features
has focused exclusively on serial computer architectures. Our objective is to show that distributed
algorithms can be employed on realistic parts with large numbers of features and many geometric and
topological entities to obtain significant improvements in computation time using existing hardware and
software tools. Migrating solid modeling applications toward a distributed computing framework enables
interconnection of many of the autonomous and geographically diverse software tools used in the modern
manufacturing enterprise.
This has been implemented on a network of SUN workstations using the ACIS solid modeler and the
NIH C++ class library; inter-processor communication is handled with TCP/IP-based network communication tools.

Abstract
We recently introduced a new flow control scheme, called send-time control, which is
based on a deterministic model of virtual circuits in a computer network. In this scheme,
the time at which a packet is sent by a source is computed from estimates of round-trip
time, traffic in the network and bottleneck service time. In this paper, we describe a new
transport protocol, called DTP, which uses send-time control as its flow control scheme.
Preliminary measurements of coast-to-coast connections over the Internet show significant
performance improvement over TCP, which is the most commonly used transport protocol
in the Internet today.

ABSTRACT
As network latency drops below disk latency, access time to a remote disk will begin
to approach local disk access time. The performance of I/O may then be improved
by spreading disk pages across several remote disk servers and accessing disk pages
in parallel. To research this we have prototyped a data page server called a Page
File. This persistent data type provides a set of methods to access disk pages stored
on a cluster of remote machines acting as disk servers. The goal is to improve the
throughput of database management system or other I/O intensive application by
accessing pages from remote disks and incurring disk latency in parallel. This report
describes the conceptual foundation and the methods of access for our prototype.

ABSTRACT
In a recent paper, Chang and Paige have shown that the usual perturbation bounds for Cholesky factors can systematically overestimate
the errors. In this note we sharpen their results and extend them to
the factors of the LU decomposition. The results are based on a new
formula for the first order terms of the error in the factors.

Abstract
This paper presents a detailed comparison of the relative importance of allowing concurrent writers
versus the choice of the underlying consistency model. Our comparison is based on single- and multiple-writer versions of a lazy release consistent (LRC) protocol, and a single-writer sequentially consistent
protocol, all implemented in the CVM software distributed shared memory system.
We find that in our environment, which we believe to be representative of distributed systems today
and in the near future, the consistency model has a much higher impact on overall performance than the
choice of whether to allow concurrent writers. The multiple writer protocol performs an average of 9%
better than the single writer LRC protocol, but 34% better than the single-writer sequentially consistent
protocol. Set against this, MW-LRC required an average of 72% memory overhead, compared to 10%
overhead for the single-writer protocols.

Abstract
We propose a hybrid method for synthesis of hierarchical structured Petri nets. In a top-down manner, we decompose a system into a set of subsystems at each level of abstraction, each
of these is specified as a blackbox Petri net that has multiple inputs and outputs. We stipulate
that each subsystem satisfies the following I/O constraints: (1) At any instance of time, at
most one of the inputs can be activated; and (2) If one input is activated, then the subsystem
must consume the input and produce exactly one output within a finite length of time. We
give a stepwise refinement procedure which starts from the initial high-level abstraction of the
system and expands an internal place of a blackbox Petri net into a more detailed subnet at
each step. By enforcing the I/O constraints of each subsystem in each intermediate abstraction,
our refinement maintains the sequencing of transitions prescribed by the initial abstraction of
the system. Next, for the bottom-up synthesis, we present interconnection rules for sequential,
parallel, and loop structures and prove that each rule maintains the I/O constraints. Thus, by
incorporating these interconnection rules into our refinement formulation, our approach can be
regarded as a hybrid Petri net synthesis technique that employs both top-down and bottom-up
methods. The major advantage of the method is that the modeling details can be introduced
incrementally and naturally, while the important logical properties of the resulting Petri net are
guaranteed.

Abstract
We propose a new bandwidth allocation scheme for VBR video traffic in ATM networks.
The scheme is tailored to MPEG-coded video sources that require stringent and deterministic
quality-of-service guarantees. By exploiting the temporal structure of MPEG sources, we show
that our scheme results in an effective bandwidth which, in most cases, is less than the source
peak rate. The reduction in the bandwidth requirement is achieved without sacrificing any
perceived QoS. Efficient procedures are provided for the computation of the effective bandwidth
under heterogeneous MPEG sources. The effective bandwidth strongly depends on the arrangement of the multiplexed streams which is a measure of the degree of synchronization between the
GOP patterns of different streams. Assuming that all possible arrangements are equi-probable,
we derive an expression for the asymptotic tail distribution of the effective bandwidth. From
the tail distribution, we compute several performance measures for the call blocking probability
when the allocation is made based on the effective bandwidth. In the case of homogeneous
sources, we give a closed-form expression for the `best' arrangement that results in the `optimal'
effective bandwidth. Numerical examples based on real MPEG traces are used to demonstrate
the advantages of our scheme.

Abstract
The Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (HCIL) and the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) have
been working together to develop the ProgramFinder, a tool for choosing programs for a troubled youth from drug
rehabilitation centers to secure residential facilities. The seemingly straightforward journey of the ProgramFinder
from an existing user interface technique to a product design required the development of five different prototypes
which involved user interface design, prototype implementation, and selecting search criterion. While HCILs effort
focused primarily on design and implementation, DJJs attribute selection process was the most time consuming and
difficult task. We also found that a direct link to DJJs workflow was needed in the prototypes to generate the
necessary buy-in. This paper analyzes the interaction between the efforts of HCIL and DJJ and the amount of buy-in by DJJ staff and management. Lesson learned are presented for developers.

Abstract: This paper presents an empirical study of several policies for managing the effect
of delay jitter on the playout of audio and video in computer-based conferences. The problem
addressed is that of managing the fundamental tradeoff between display with low latency and
display with few gaps. We describe a particular policy called queue monitoring which
observes delay jitter over time and dynamically adjusts display latency in order to support
low-latency conferences with an acceptable gap rate. Queue monitoring is evaluated by
comparing it with two policies from the literature in a study based on measurements from a
computer-based conferencing system. Our results show that queue monitoring performs as
well or better than the other policies over the range of observed network loads. More
importantly, we show that queue monitoring performs better on those network loads for
which the other policies exhibit poor performance.

//abstract
Abstract
This paper considers the use of lock-free shared objects
within hard real-time systems. As the name suggests,
lock-free shared objects are distinguished by the fact
that they are not locked. As such, they do not give
rise to priority inversions, a key advantage over conventional, lock-based object-sharing approaches. Despite this advantage, it is not immediately apparent
that lock-free shared objects can be employed if tasks
must adhere to strict timing constraints. In particular,
lock-free object implementations permit concurrent operations to interfere with each other, and repeated interferences can cause a given operation to take an arbitrarily long time to complete.
The main contribution of this paper is to show that
such interferences can be bounded by judicious scheduling. This work pertains to periodic, hard real-time
tasks that share lock-free objects on a uniprocessor. In
the first part of the paper, scheduling conditions are derived for such tasks, for both static and dynamic priority schemes. Based on these conditions, it is formally
shown that lock-free object-sharing approaches can be
expected to incur much less overhead than approaches
based on wait-free objects or lock-based schemes. In
the last part of the paper, this conclusion is validated experimentally through work involving a real-time desktop videoconferencing system.

//abstract
ABSTRACT
Sync is a new Java-based framework for developing collaborative applications for wireless mobile
systems. Sync is based on objectoriented replication and offers high-level synchronization-aware classes
based on existing Java classes. Programmers may also extend the Sync-provided classes to create new
replicated classes, either to add functionality or to modify a classs merge policy. Sync supports fully
disconnected operation and employs centralized, asynchronous synchronization. Application programmers
use the Sync framework to define conflicts and specify conflict resolution on the basis of the applications
structure and semantics.
We discuss the general needs of wireless mobile applications, and present a high-function example
application that would be useful to mobile users, to be used for illustration throughout the paper. Next we
discuss related work, and evaluate each work relative to its ability to support the example application. We
then present the Sync framework, motivating each feature with its use in the example application.

Abstract
Naming plays a key role in the design of any system that exports services or resources. Object systems
may export many different categories of names: instances, components of records, types, etc. Operating
systems export the names of files, devices, and services. Integrating an object base with existing operating system facilities can improve accessibility of the
object base resources. We consider the benefits and
pitfalls of integrating an object base namespace with
the Unix namespace. 1

Integrating persistence into an existing programming language is a serious undertaking. Preserving the essence of the existing language, adequately supporting persistence, and maintaining efficiency require low-level support from the compiler and runtime systems. Pervasive,
low-level changes were made to a Lisp compiler and runtime system to introduce persistence.
The result is an efficient language which is worthy of the name Persistent Lisp. 1

Abstract
Many emerging applications (e.g., teleconference, real-time
information services, pay per view, distributed interactive
simulation, and collaborative work) are based upon a group
communications model, i.e., they require packet delivery
from one or more authorized senders to a very large number
of authorized receivers. As a result, securing group communications (i.e., providing confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages delivered between group members)
will become a critical networking issue.
In this paper, we present a novel solution to the scalability problem of group/multicast key management. We
formalize the notion of a secure group as a triple (U; K; R)
where U denotes a set of users, K a set of keys held by the
users, and R a user-key relation. We then introduce key
graphs to specify secure groups. For a special class of key
graphs, we present three strategies for securely distributing rekey messages after a join/leave, and specify protocols
for joining and leaving a secure group. The rekeying strategies and join/leave protocols are implemented in a prototype
group key server we have built. We present measurement
results from experiments and discuss performance comparisons. We show that our group key management service, using any of the three rekeying strategies, is scalable to large
groups with frequent joins and leaves. In particular, the
average measured processing time per join/leave increases
linearly with the logarithm of group size.

Abstract
Planning systems have become an important tool for automating a wide variety
of tasks. Control knowledge guides a planner to find solutions quickly and is crucial
for efficient planning in most domains. Machine learning techniques enable a planning
system to automatically acquire domain-specific search-control knowledge for different
applications. Past approaches to learning control information have usually employed
explanation-based learning (EBL) to generate control rules. Unfortunately, EBL alone
often produces overly complex rules that actually decrease rather than improve overall
planning efficiency. This paper presents a novel learning approach for control knowledge
acquisition that integrates explanation-based learning with techniques from inductive
logic programming. In our learning system Scope, EBL is used to constrain an inductive search for control heuristics that help a planner choose between competing plan
refinements. Scope is one of the few systems to address learning control information for newer, partial-order planners. Specifically, this proposal describes how Scope
learns domain-specific control rules for the UCPOP planning algorithm. The resulting
system is shown to produce significant speedup in two different planning domains, and
to be more effective than a pure EBL approach. Future research will be performed
in three main areas. First, Scope's learning algorithm will be extended to include
additional techniques such as constructive induction and rule utility analysis. Second,
Scope will be more thoroughly tested; several real-world planning domains have been
identified as possible testbeds, and more in-depth comparisons will be drawn between
Scope and other competing approaches. Third, Scope will be implemented in a different planning system in order to test its portability to other planning algorithms. This
work should demonstrate that machine-learning techniques can be a powerful tool in
the quest for tractable real-world planning.

Abstract
A common task in automated manufacturing processes is to orient parts prior to
assembly. We address sensorless orientation of a polygonal part on a conveyor belt by
a sequence of stationary fences across this belt. Since fences can only push against the
motion of the belt, it is a challenging problem to compute fence designs which orients
a given part. In this paper, we give several polynomial-time, algorithms to compute
fence designs which are optimal with respect to various criteria. We address both
frictionless and frictional fences. We also compute modular fence designs in which
the fence angles are restricted to a discrete set of angles instead of an interval.

Abstract
A bandwidth control mechanism is proposed for ATM
networks that can control the usage of bandwidth in the
presence of both connection-oriented and connection-less traffic, as well as multiple classes of connectionless
traffic. The bandwidth control mechanism operates at
three levels. At the topmost level, bandwidth is dynamically regulated between connection-oriented and
connectionless traffic based on the utilization of each
traffic type. At the next level, bandwidth is controlled
between different classes of connectionless traffic, such
as real-time traffic, bulk data traffic, and so on. At the
lowest level, bandwidth is distributed among flows belonging to the same connectionless traffic class.

Abstract. The demand for computing and computing power is increasing at a rapid pace. With this demand,
the ability to develop, enhance and maintain software is a top priority. Educating students to do competent
work in software development, enhancement and maintenance has become a complex problem. Software
engineering concepts are typically not introduced in beginning computer science courses. Students do not see
software engineering until the third or fourth year of the curriculum. We do not believe students can acquire
an adequate software engineering foundation with the present approach. We believe an emphasis on software
engineering should begin in the very first course and continue throughout the curriculum. We are redesigning
our curriculum to reect this. The first course of the new curriculum is complete. This article focuses on two
of the laboratory activities we have developed which deal with specific software engineering concepts.

Isotach Networks
//author
Paul F. Reynolds, Jr.

//abstract
Abstract We introduce a class of networks called isotach networks designed to reduce the
cost of concurrency control in asynchronous computations. Isotach networks support several
properties important to the correct execution of parallel and distributed computations: atomi-city, causal message delivery, sequential consistency, and memory coherence in systems in
which shared data can replicate and migrate. They allow processes to execute atomic actions
without locks and to pipeline memory accesses without sacrificing sequential consistency. Iso-tach networks can be implemented in a wide variety of configurations, including NUMA (nonuniform memory access) multiprocessors and distributed as well as parallel systems. Networks
that implement isotach time systems are characterized not by their topology, but by the guarantees they make about the relative order in which messages appear to be delivered. These
guarantees are expressed in logical time, not physical time. Physical time guarantees would be
prohibitively expensive, whereas logical time guarantees can be enforced cheaply, using purely
local knowledge, and yet are powerful enough to support efficient techniques for coordinating
asynchronously executing processes. Empirical and analytic studies of isotach systems show
that they outperform conventional systems under realistic workloads, in some cases by an order
of magnitude or more.

Abstract
Tracing tools are used widely to help analyze, design, and tune
both hardware and software systems. This paper describes a tool
called Shade which combines efficient instruction-set simulation
with a flexible, extensible trace generation capability. Efficiency
is achieved by dynamically compiling and caching code to simulate and trace the application program. The user may control the
extent of tracing in a variety of ways; arbitrarily detailed application state information may be collected during the simulation, but
tracing less translates directly into greater efficiency. Current
Shade implementations run on SPARC systems and simulate the
SPARC (Versions 8 and 9) and MIPS I instruction sets. This
paper describes the capabilities, design, implementation, and performance of Shade, and discusses instruction set emulation in
general.

Abstract
In computer systems with large, physically-indexed,
direct-mapped caches, a poor mapping from virtual to
physical pages causes excessive cache conflict misses.
In a previous paper we proposed a simple hardware device, the Cache Miss Lookaside (CML) Buffer, which
identifies pages that are suffering from conflict misses.
The operating system can use this information to implement a dynamic page mapping policy that resolves
conflicts by performing an in-memory copy of one of
the conflicting pages, and updating the virtual to physical mappings. In this paper, we propose several dynamic page mapping policies that detect and resolve
cache conflicts using hardware available in existing systems, such as a TLB and cache miss counter, to locate
possible cache conflicts. We evaluate the simulated
performance of a variety of mapping policies, and show
that a dynamic page mapping policy using standard
hardware can improve upon the performance of a static
policy, but is not as effective as special-purpose hardware such as an associative cache or a CML buffer.
We also describe the implementation and performance
of a software-based dynamic policy on a DEC Alpha
workstation running DEC OSF/1.

Abstract
User-level threads have performance and flexibility advantages over both Unix-like processes
and kernel threads. However, the performance of user-level threads may suffer in multipro-grammed environments, or when threads block in the kernel (e.g., for I/O). These problems
can be particularly severe in tasks that communicate frequently using IPC (e.g., multithreaded
servers), due to interactions between the user-level thread scheduler and the operating system
IPC primitives. Efficient IPC typically involves processor handoff that blocks the caller and
unblocks a thread in the callee; when combined with user-level threads, this can cause problems
for both caller and callee, particularly if the caller thread should subsequently block.
In this paper we describe a new user-level thread package, called OThreads, designed to
support blocking and efficient IPC for a system based on traditional kernel threads. We discuss
the extent to which these problems can be solved at the user level without kernel changes
such as scheduler activations. Our conclusion is that problems caused by application-controlled
blocking and IPC can be resolved in the user-level thread package, but that problems due
to multiprogramming workload and unanticipated blocking such as page faults require kernel
changes such as scheduler activations.

Abstract
We present a new method for accelerating walkthroughs of geometrically complex static
scenes. As a preprocessing step, our method constructs a BSP-tree that hierarchically partitions the geometric primitives in the scene. In the course of a walkthrough, images of nodes
at various levels of the hierarchy are cached for reuse in subsequent frames. A cached image is applied as a texture map to a single quadrilateral that is drawn instead of the geometry
contained in the corresponding node. Visual artifacts are kept under control by using an error metric that quantifies the discrepancy between the appearance of the geometry contained
in a node and the cached image. The new method is shown to achieve significant speedups
for a walkthrough of a complex outdoor scene, with little or no loss in rendering quality.

Abstract
Subdivision surfaces provide a curved surface representation that is useful in a number of applications, including modeling surfaces of arbitrary topological type [5] , fitting scattered data [6] , and geometric compression
and automatic level-of-detail generation using wavelets [8] . Subdivision surfaces also provide an attractive representation for fast rendering, since they can directly represent complex surfaces of arbitrary topology. This direct
representation contrasts with traditional approaches such as trimmed NURBS, in which tesselating trim regions
dominates rendering time, and algebraic implicit surfaces, in which rendering requires resultants, root finders, or
other computationally expensive techniques.
We present a method for subdivision surface triangulation that is fast, uses minimum memory, and is simpler in
structure than a naive rendering method based on direct subdivision. These features make the algorithm amenable
to implementation on dedicated geometry engine processors, allowing high rendering performance on appropri
ately equipped graphics hardware.

Abstract
Linear equality and inequality constraints arise naturally in specifying many aspects of user
interfaces, such as requiring that one window be to the left of another, requiring that a pane
occupy the leftmost 1/3 of a window, or preferring that an object be contained within a rectangle if possible. Current constraint solvers designed for UI applications cannot efficiently
handle simultaneous linear equations and inequalities. This is a major limitation. We describe
Cassowary|an incremental algorithm based on the dual simplex method that can solve such
systems of constraints efficiently.
//note
This informal technical report describes the latest version of the Cassowary algorithm. It is
derived from the paper "Solving Linear Arithmetic Constraints for User Interface Applications"
by Alan Borning, Kim Marriott, Peter Stuckey, and Yi Xiao [7], published in the UIST'97
Proceedings. The UIST paper also contains a description of QOCA, a closely related solver
that finds least-squares solutions to linear constraints. This technical report, which is intended
to be self-contained, includes material on Cassowary from the UIST paper, plus a description
of the Java, C++, and Smalltalk implementations and their interfaces. along with additional
details, corrections, and clarifications.
An earlier technical report also discussed QOCA and the similarities between Cassowary and
that algorithm [6].

On multivariate polynomial interpolation

//abstract
ABSTRACT
We provide a map fi 7! fi which associates each finite set fi of points in C s with a polynomial
space fi from which interpolation to arbitrary data given at the points in fi is possible and uniquely
so. Among all polynomial spaces Q from which interpolation at fi is uniquely possible, our fi
is of smallest degree. It is also D- and scale-invariant. Our map is monotone, thus providing a
Newton form for the resulting interpolant. Our map is also continuous within reason, allowing us to
interpret certain cases of coalescence as Hermite interpolation. In fact, our map can be extended to
the case where, with each 2 fi, there is associated a polynomial space P , and, for given smooth
f , a polynomial q 2 Q is sought for which
p(D)(f q)() = 0; all p 2 P ; 2 fi:
We obtain fi as the "scaled limit at the origin" (Exp fi ) # of the exponential space Exp fi with
frequencies fi, and base our results on a study of the map H 7! H # defined on subspaces H of
the space of functions analytic at the origin. This study also allows us to determine the local
approximation order from such H and provides an algorithm for the construction of H # from any
basis for H.

Abstract
We present an approach for recovering surface shape from the occluding contour using an active (i.e., moving) observer. It is based on a relation between the geometries of
a surface in a scene and its occluding contour: If the viewing direction of the observer
is along a principal direction for a surface point whose projection is on the contour,
surface shape (i.e., curvature) at the surface point can be recovered from the contour.
Unlike previous approaches for recovering shape from the occluding contour, we use an
observer that purposefully changes viewpoint in order to achieve a well-defined geometric relationship with respect to a 3D shape prior to its recognition. We show that there
is a simple and efficient viewing strategy that allows the observer to align their viewing
direction with one of the two principal directions for a point on the surface. This strategy depends on only curvature measurements on the occluding contour and therefore
demonstrates that recovering quantitative shape information from the contour does not
require knowledge of the velocities or accelerations of the observer. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can be easily implemented and can provide reliable shape
information from the occluding contour.

Abstract
A team of learning machines is a multiset of
learning machines. A team is said to successfully learn a concept just in case each member
of some nonempty subset, of predetermined
size, of the team learns the concept.
Team learning of computer programs for
computable functions from their graphs has
been studied extensively. However, team
learning of languages turns out to be a
more suitable theoretical model for studying
computational limits on multi-agent machine
learning. The main reason for this is that
language learning can model both learning
from positive data and learning from positive
and negative data, whereas function learning
models only learning from positive and negative data.
Some theoretical results about learnability of
formal languages by teams of algorithmic machines are surveyed. Some new results about
restricted classes of languages are presented.
These results are mainly about two issues: redundancy and aggregation. The issue of redundancy deals with the impact of increasing
the size of a team and increasing the number
of machines required to be successful. The
issue of aggregation deals with conditions under which a team may be replaced by a single
machine without any loss in learning ability.
Scenarios which can be modeled by team
learning are also presented.

Abstract
The problem of assigning m points in the n-dimensional real space
R n to k clusters is formulated as that of determining k centers in
R n such that the sum of distances of each point to the nearest
center is minimized. If a polyhedral distance is used, the problem
can be formulated as that of minimizing a piecewise-linear concave
function on a polyhedral set which is shown to be equivalent to
a bilinear program: minimizing a bilinear function on a polyhedral set. A fast finite k-Median Algorithm consisting of solving
few linear programs in closed form leads to a stationary point of
the bilinear program. Computational testing on a number of real-world databases was carried out. On the Wisconsin Diagnostic
Breast Cancer (WDBC) database, k-Median training set correctness was comparable to that of the k-Mean Algorithm, however its
testing set correctness was better. Additionally, on the Wisconsin
Prognostic Breast Cancer (WPBC) database, distinct and clinically important survival curves were extracted by the k-Median
Algorithm, whereas the k-Mean Algorithm failed to obtain such
distinct survival curves for the same database.

Abstract
In an effort to push the envelope of system performance, microprocessor designs are continually exploiting higher levels of
instruction-level parallelism, resulting in increasing bandwidth demands on the address translation mechanism. Most current microprocessor designs meet this demand with a multi-ported TLB. While
this design provides an excellent hit rate at each port, its access latency and area grow very quickly as the number of ports is increased.
As bandwidth demands continue to increase, multi-ported designs
will soon impact memory access latency.
We present four high-bandwidth address translation mechanisms
with latency and area characteristics that scale better than a multi-ported TLB design. We extend traditional high-bandwidth memory
design techniques to address translation, developing interleaved and
multi-level TLB designs. In addition, we introduce two new designs
crafted specifically for high-bandwidth address translation. Piggyback ports are introduced as a technique to exploit spatial locality in
simultaneous translation requests, allowing accesses to the same virtual memory page to combine their requests at the TLB access port.
Pretranslation is introduced as a technique for attaching translations
to base register values, making it possible to reuse a single translation many times.
We perform extensive simulation-based studies to evaluate our
designs. We vary key system parameters, such as processor model,
page size, and number of architected registers, to see what effects
these changes have on the relative merits of each approach. A number of designs show particular promise. Multi-level TLBs with as
few as eight entries in the upper-level TLB nearly achieve the performance of a TLB with unlimited bandwidth. Piggyback ports
combined with a lesser-ported TLB structure, e.g., an interleaved or
multi-ported TLB, also perform well. Pretranslation over a single-ported TLB performs almost as well as a same-sized multi-level
TLB with the added benefit of decreased access latency for physically indexed caches.

Abstract
This report presents results of a peer review of MQPs conducted within
the Computer Science Department during the Summer of 1995 as part of a
campus-wide MQP review. The goal of the report is to assess whether the
department MQPs are accomplishing their educational goals. The report
identifies problems that need to be addressed and trends that need to be
continued to make the MQPs a worthwhile learning experience. It reflects
data and evaluations for 27 MQPs, involving 43 computer science students,
that were completed between the Summer of 1994 and the Spring of 1995.
The report also makes comparisons to similar reviews done in 1991 and 1993.
Overall, the large majority of the projects are meeting the educational
goals of the department as good learning experiences. The reviews indicate
the overall quality of the projects is good, about the same as in 1993 and
a little better than 1991. The report draws a number of conclusions about
the success of the projects based upon the data collected and evaluations
done for this review. The report concludes with recommendations for future
projects.

Abstract: High Performance Fortran (HPF) compilers
and communication libraries with the standardized Message Passing Interface (MPI) are becoming widely available, easing the development of portable parallel applications on distributed-memory parallel processor systems.
The recently developed Annai tool environment supports
programming, debugging and tuning of both HPF- and
MPI-based applications. Considering code development
and subsequent maintenance time to be as important as ultimate performance, we address how sequential Fortran-77
versions of the familiar NAS Parallel Benchmark kernels
can be expediently parallelized with appropriate tool support. While automatic parallelization of scientific applications written in traditional sequential languages remains
largely impractical, Annai provides users with high-level
language extensions and integrated program engineering
support tools. In this paper, Annai support is demonstrated primarily focusing on the MG (multigrid) kernel,
with complementary examples selected from the other four
kernels. Respectable performance and good scalability
in most cases are obtained with this straightforward par-allelization strategy, even without recourse to platform-specific optimizations or major program transformations.

Abstract
Explanations play a key role in operationalization-based anomaly detection techniques. In this paper
we show that their role is not limited to anomaly detection; they can also be used for guiding automated
knowledge base refinement. We introduce a refinement procedure which takes: (i) a small number of
refinement rules (rather than test cases), and (ii) explanations constructed in an attempt to reveal the
cause (or causes) for inconsistencies detected during
the verification process, and returns rule revisions
aiming to recover the consistency of the KB-theory.
Inconsistencies caused by more than one anomaly
are handled at the same time, which improves the
efficiency of the refinement process.

//abstract
Abstract
In this paper, syntactic parsing is discussed in the context of connectionism. A new model - the Confluent
Preorder Parser (CPP), is proposed which exemplifies the holistic parsing paradigm. Holistic parsing has the
advantage that little assumption has to be made concerning the detailed parsing algorithm, which is often
unknown or debatable, especially when human language understanding is concerned. In the CPP, syntactic
parsing is achieved by transforming in a oneshot manner, from the connectionist representation of the sentence
to the connectionist representation of the preorder traversal of its parse tree, instead of the parse tree itself. As
revealed by the simulation experiments, generalization performance is excellent (as high as 90%). Besides, the
CPP is also capable of parsing erroneous sentences and resolving syntactic ambiguities. A systematic study is
conducted to explore the range of factors which can affect the effectiveness of it. This error-recovery capability
is especially useful in natural language processing when incomplete or even ungrammatical sentences are to be
dealt with.

Abstract
Situated cognition (SC) claims that knowledge is mostly context-dependent and that symbolic descriptions elicited prior to direct experience are less important than functional units developed via direct
experience with the current problem. If this were true, then we would need to modify the knowledge
modeling approaches of KA which assume that re-using old symbolic descriptions are a productivity tool
for new applications. There are numerous tools which, if added to conventional knowledge modeling,
could be said to handle SC (e.g. machine learning, abduction, verification & validation tools, repertory
grids, certain frameworks for decision support systems, expert critiquing systems, and ripple-down-rules).
However, we require an experiment to assess the effectiveness of these tools as a response to SC.

Abstract
This paper presents Splice, a batch meta-learning system, designed to learn locally stable concepts in domains with hidden changes
in context. The majority of machine learning
algorithms assume that target concepts remain stable over time. In many domains this
assumption is invalid. For example, financial prediction, medical diagnosis, and network performance are domains in which target concepts may not remain stable. Unstable target concepts are often due to changes
in a hidden context. Existing works on learning in the presence of hidden changes in con
text use an incremental learning approach.

Abstract
We analyze differences between two
information-theoretically motivated approaches to statistical inference and model
selection: the Minimum Description Length
(MDL) principle, and the Minimum Message
Length (MML) principle. Based on this
analysis, we present two revised versions of
MML: a pointwise estimator which gives
the MML-optimal single parameter model,
and a volumewise estimator which gives
the MML-optimal region in the parameter
space. Our empirical results suggest that
with small data sets, the MDL approach
yields more accurate predictions than the
MML estimators. The empirical results
also demonstrate that the revised MML
estimators introduced here perform better
than the original MML estimator suggested
by Wallace and Freeman.

Abstract
The graph topo-visual formalism has been shown to
be well-suited to the task of visualizing complex relations on a set of elements. Unfortunately, most visual
formalisms do not scale very well. This observation is
particularly true of graphs, which even when hand-drawn
by an artist, are seldom meaningful when the number of
nodes or links exceeds a very modest threshold typically only a few hundred elements. This severe limitation
has prompted many researchers to seek alternative visualization techniques that may eliminate, or, at the very
least, raise this threshold.
In this paper we analyze these recent efforts, describe
an abstract space of presentation emphasis techniques,
and locate the current approaches within this space. The
contributions of this paper are several: (1) a significant
portion of recent work is collected and reviewed; (2) a
common set of criteria and a taxonomy of graph views
are proposed; these, (3) permit a more direct comparison
of previous work; which helps to, (4) identify common
shortcomings and limitations; which in turn, (5) suggest
future directions.

Abstract. We provide concise abstract code for running the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to execute compiled Java programs, and define a
general compilation scheme of Java programs to JVM code. These definitions, together with the definition of an abstract interpreter of Java
programs given in our previous work [3], allow us to prove that any
compiler that satisfies the conditions stated in this paper compiles Java
code correctly. In addition we have validated our JVM and compiler
specification through experimentation.
The modularity of our definitions for Java, the JVM and the compilation
scheme exhibit orthogonal language, machine and compiler components,
which fit together and provide the basis for a stepwise and provably correct design-for-reuse. As a by-product we provide a challenging realistic
case study for mechanical verification of a compiler correctness proof.

Abstract. We use the steam boiler control specification problem to illustrate how the evolving algebra approach to the specification and the
verification of complex systems can be exploited for a reliable and well
documented development of executable, but formally inspectable and
systematically modifiable code. A hierarchy of stepwise refined abstract
machine models is developed, the ground version of which can be checked
for whether it faithfully reflects the informally given problem. The sequence of machine models yields various abstract views of the system,
making the various design decisions transparent, and leads to a C++
program. This program has been demonstrated during the Dagstuhl-Meeting on Methods for Semantics and Specification, in June 1995, to
control the Karlsruhe steam boiler simulator satisfactorily.
The abstract machines are evolving algebras and thereby have a rigorous
semantical foundation, allowing us to formalize and prove, under precisely stated assumptions, some typical sample properties of the system.
This provides insight into the structure of the system which supports
easily maintainable extensions and modifications of both the abstract
specification and the implementation.

Abstract
Drawing on on our work in the area of Distributed Artificial Intelligence, we propose the rudiments of a view of multiagent reasoning that relates current philosophical
intuitions, theoretical foundations, and preliminary implementation. The philosophical
position we take is a combination of Daniel Dennett's philosophy of the ladder of per-sonhood (consisting of rationality, intentionality, stance, reciprocity, communication,
and consciousness) on one hand, and the utilitarian philosophy of selfish utility maximization on the other hand. The theories we incorporate are logics of knowledge and
belief, which in addressing the multiagent issues can be developed based on a recursive
version of the Kripke structure, and the related fields of utility, decision and game
theories. Our preliminary implementation, the Recursive Modeling Method (RMM),
lets an agent coordinate its actions with the actions of other agents, cooperate with
them when appropriate, and rationally choose an optimal form of communication with
them.

Abstract
Plan recognition is the process of observing another agent's behavior(s) and inferring what, and
possibly why, the agent is acting as it is. Plan recognition becomes a very important means of acquiring
such information about other agents in situations and domains where explicit communication is either
very costly, dangerous, or impossible. Performing plan recognition in a physical domain (i.e. the real
world) forces the world's ubiquitous uncertainty upon the observing agent because of the necessity to
use real sensors to make the observations. We have developed a multiple resolution, hierarchical plan
recognition system to coordinate the motion of two interacting mobile robots. Uncertainty arises in the
system from dead reckoning errors that accumulate while the robots are moving, as well as by errors
in the computer vision system that is used to detect the other agent's behaviors. Based upon belief
networks, the plan recognition system gracefully degrades in performance as the level of uncertainty
about observations increase.

Abstract
We describe a flexible experimental testbed, called MICE, for distributed artificial intelligence
research. We argue that the adoption of MICE (or some other standard testbed) by the distributed
artificial intelligence community can draw together the community and permit a much greater level
of exchange of ideas, formalisms, and techniques. MICE allows an experimenter to specify the
constraints and characteristics of an environment in which agents are simulated to act and interact,
and does not assume any particular implementation of an agent's reasoning architecture. MICE
therefore provides a platform for investigating and evaluating alternative reasoning architectures
and coordination mechanisms in many different simulated environments. We outline the design
of MICE and illustrate its flexibility by describing simulated environments that model the coordination issues in domains such as predators chasing prey, predators attacking each other, agents
fighting a fire, and diverse robots that are working together. In addition, we note that MICE's
ability to simulate multi-agent environments makes it an ideal platform for studying reasoning in
dynamic worlds; we can associate functionality to arbitrary objects in order to trigger changes in
the environment. We conclude by discussing the status of MICE and how we are using MICE in
our current research.

ABSTRACT
In this paper, a method is introduced for incorporating perfectly registered MRI boundary information into
a penalized likelihood emission reconstruction scheme.
The boundary curve is modeled as a periodic spline
whose coefficients are estimated from the MRI image.
The resulting boundary estimate is mapped to a spatially variant set of Gibbs weights. When incorporated into a quadratic roughness penalty, these weights
improve emission reconstruction bias/variance performance by preventing smoothing across the estimated
boundary.

Abstract
Efficient path computation necessary for route guidance has been identified as one of the key requirements
for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. While the current ITS literature has focused on
the application of search algorithms (typically, heuristic A* algorithms) to provide for compute-on-demand
path finding, we propose an encoded path view approach that precomputes optimal paths. Advantages of
our approach include (1) route search is efficient and less dependent on system load, (2) alternative paths
are materialized in addition to the optimal paths, simplifying the process of global optimization, (3) the
storage overhead is manageable and less than for the full enumeration of all possible paths. In this paper,
we present algorithms for incrementally updating the encoded path view structure in response to weight
changes on the traffic links of the underlying network. Despite non-optimal paths also being materialized, our
algorithms are designed to operate on cyclic planar graphs | given that ITS maps typically correspond to
highly interconnected grid structures. In this paper, we show that while our approach does not encode all
paths, it omits some non-optimal paths to resolve cycle ambivalence and will recover them once they become
optimal. Proofs of correctness and of complexity are also given. We demonstrate the potential of our approach
by presenting experimental results of evaluating our approach both on randomly generated as well as on real
city map data. Our experiments furthermore compare the proposed approach against more conventional path
searching algorithms, which correspond to the state-of-the-art for route guidance in ITS.

Abstract
Efficient path query processing necessary for route guidance has been identified as one of the key requirements
for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications.
While precomputing the view of all shortest paths provides
the most efficient path retrieval, the view maintenance and
storage costs become unrealistic for large ITS networks. Based
on ITS road type classification, we propose a hierarchical
path view approach, in which the path view maintenance
and storage costs are dramatically reduced at the cost of
negligible loss of path optimality. Comparing with the traditional ITS path finding approaches that use A or hierarchical A , our hierarchical approach is superior in three
areas: 1) path search is more efficient, 2) the connecting
point from the low-level roads to the high-level roads and
vice versa are dynamically determined based on the most
recent traffic, 3) within one region, the high-level traffic can
be dynamically rerouted through the low-level roads. In
this paper, we conduct experiments to gain insight into the
performance of our proposed algorithms and model, as well
as to contrast the difference in computational resource requirements between the hierarchical path view and the A
algorithms.

Abstract
We examine a standard factory scheduling
problem with stochastic processing and setup
times, minimizing the expectation of the
weighted number of tardy jobs. Because
the costs of operators in the schedule are
stochastic and sequence dependent, standard
dynamic programming algorithms such as
A* may fail to find the optimal schedule.
The SDA* (Stochastic Dominance A*) algorithm remedies this difficulty by relaxing the
pruning condition. We present an improved
state-space search formulation for these problems and discuss the conditions under which
stochastic scheduling problems can be solved
optimally using SDA*. In empirical testing
on randomly generated problems, we found
that in 70%, the expected cost of the optimal stochastic solution is lower than that of
the solution derived using a deterministic ap
proximation, with comparable search effort.

Abstract
Concept hierarchies organize data and concepts in hierarchical forms or in certain partial order, which
helps expressing knowledge and data relationships in databases in concise, high level terms, and thus, plays
an important role in knowledge discovery processes. Concept hierarchies could be provided by knowledge
engineers, domain experts or users, or embedded in some data relations. However, it is sometimes desirable to automatically generate some concept hierarchies or adjust some given hierarchies for particular
learning tasks. In this paper, the issues of dynamic generation and refinement of concept hierarchies are
studied. The study leads to some algorithms for automatic generation of concept hierarchies for numerical attributes based on data distributions and for dynamic refinement of a given or generated concept
hierarchy based on a learning request, the relevant set of data and database statistics. These algorithms
have been implemented in the DBLearn knowledge discovery system and tested against large relational
databases. The experimental results show that the algorithms are efficient and effective for knowledge
discovery in large databases.

Multi-Agent Planning as a Dynamic Search for Social Consensus

//abstract
Abstract
When autonomous agents attempt to coordinate action, it is often necessary that they reach
some kind of consensus. Reaching consensus
has traditionally been dealt with in the Distributed Artificial Intelligence literature via negotiation. Another alternative is to have agents
use a voting mechanism; each agent expresses
its preferences, and a group choice mechanism
is used to select the result. Some choice mechanisms are better than others, and ideally we
would like one that cannot be manipulated by
untruthful agents.
Coordination of actions by a group of agents
corresponds to a group planning process. We
here introduce a new multi-agent planning
technique, that makes use of a dynamic, iterative search procedure. Through a process of
group constraint aggregation, agents incrementally construct a plan that brings the group to
a state maximizing social welfare. At each step,
agents vote about the next joint action in the
group plan (i.e., what the next transition state
will be in the emerging plan). Using this technique agents need not fully reveal their preferences, and the set of alternative final states
need not be generated in advance of a vote.
With a minor variation, the entire procedure
can be made resistant to untruthful agents.

Abstract
Formal technical review (FTR) is an essential component of all modern software quality assessment, assurance,
and improvement techniques, and is acknowledged to be
the most cost-effective form of quality improvement when
practiced effectively. However, traditional FTR methods
such as inspection are very difficult to adopt in organizations: they introduce substantial new up-front costs,
training, overhead, and group process obstacles. Sustained commitment from high-level management along
with substantial resources is often necessary for successful
technology transfer of FTR.
Since 1991, we have been designing and evaluating
a series of versions of a system called CSRS: an instrumented, computer-supported cooperative work environment for formal technical review. The current version of
CSRS includes an FTR method definition language, which
allows organizations to design their own FTR method,
and to evolve it over time. This paper describes how our
approach to computer supported FTR can address some
of the issues in technology transfer of FTR.

Abstract
Current collaborative learning systems focus on maximizing shared information.
However, meaningful learning is not simply information sharing but also knowledge
construction. CLARE is a computer-supported learning environment that facilitates
meaningful learning through collaborative knowledge construction. It provides a semiformal representation language called RESRA and an explicit process model called
SECAI. Experimental evaluation through 300 hours of classroom usage indicates that
CLARE does support meaningful learning. It also shows that a major bottleneck to
computer-mediated knowledge construction is summarization. Lessons learned through
the design and evaluation of CLARE provide new insights into both collaborative learning
systems and collaborative learning theories.

Combinatory Differential Fields:

November 1991
//abstract
Abstract
The algebraic structure of combinatory differential fields is constructed to provide a semantics for computations in analysis. In this setting programs, approximations, limits and operations of analysis are represented
as algebraic terms. Analytic algorithms can be derived by algebraic methods. The main tool in this construction are combinatory models which are inner algebras of Engeler graph models. As an universal domain
of denotational semantics the lattice structure of the graph models allows to give a striking simple semantics
for computations with approximations. As models of combinatory algebra they provide all essential computational constructs, including recursion. Combinatory models are constructed as extensions of first order
theories. The classical first order theory to describe analysis is the theory of differential fields. It turns out
that two types of computational constructs, namely composition and piecewise definition of functions, are
preferably introduced as extensions of the differential fields theory. Combinatory differential fields are then
the combinatory models of these enriched differential fields. We show for basic algorithms of computational
analysis how their combinatory counterparts are derived in the algebraic setting. We illustrate how these
algorithms are suitable to be implemented in a computer algebra environment like mathematica.

A Study of Perceptually
Grounded Polysemy in a Spatial

August 1992
//abstract
Abstract
This paper attempts to exemplify the advantages of perceptually grounded semantics with respect to traditional formalist approaches in elucidating the nature of the
controversial notion of linguistic polysemy, or multiplicity of meaning. It is also suggested how some aspects of language typically associated with compositionality could
be modeled, without there being a strictly "compositional semantics".
This is done through a series of experiments, using modifications of Terry Regier's
connectionist system for learning spatial relations [Regier, 1992] which constitutes a
part of the L 0 project concerned with associating descriptions in an arbitrary language
with an analog environment, (sequences of) pictures of simple 2-dimensional scenes.
The emphasis is above all on the English preposition `over', famous for its poly-semy, and analyzed in detail by [Brugman, 1981] and [Lakoff, 1987], but some modeling has been also done of the meaning of `under', as well as some rudimentary
semantics for simple verbs such as `be', `go' and `fly' that combine with the two
prepositions.

The paper considers the problem of computing a maximal independent set
in a hypergraph (see [3] and [7]). We present an efficient deterministic NC
algorithm for finding a maximal independent set in a hypergraph of dimension
3: the algorithm runs in time O(log 4 n) time on n + m processors of an
EREW PRAM and is optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor. Our algorithm
adapts the technique of Goldberg and Spencer ([5]) for finding a maximal
independent set in a graph (or hypergraph of dimension 2). It is the first
efficient NC algorithm for finding a maximal independent set in a hypergraph
of dimension greater than 2.

Abstract
We present a compositional model of paper transportation in a photocopier that is meant to
support different problem solving tasks like simulation and diagnosis, and to be applicable to
a variety of configurations. Therefore, we try to avoid making hard-wired implicit assumptions
about design principles and possible scenarios. In order to simplify our analysis, the model
abstracts away from the physical forces and reasons only about velocities. Nonetheless, it
succeeds in determining essential features of the motion of the sheet of paper like buckling
and tearing. The framework provided is quite generic and can be used as a starting point for
developing models of other transportation domains.

Parallel Sorting With Limited

July 1995
//abstract
Abstract
We study the problem of sorting on a parallel computer with limited communication
bandwidth. By using the recently proposed PRAM(m) model, where p processors
communicate through a small, globally shared memory consisting of m bits, we focus
on the trade-off between the amount of local computation and the amount of inter-processor communication required for parallel sorting algorithms. We prove a lower
bound of ( n log m
m ) on the time to sort n numbers in an exclusive-read variant of
the PRAM(m) model. We show that Leighton's Columnsort can be used to give
an asymptotically matching upper bound in the case where m grows as a fractional
power of n. The bounds are of a surprising form, in that they have little dependence
on the parameter p. This implies that attempting to distribute the workload across
more processors while holding the problem size and the size of the shared memory
fixed will not improve the optimal running time of sorting in this model. We also
show that both the upper and the lower bound can be adapted to bridging models
that address the issue of limited communication bandwidth: the LogP model and
the BSP model. The lower bounds provide convincing evidence that efficient parallel
algorithms for sorting rely strongly on high communication bandwidth.

Abstract
The burstiness of variable bit rate traffic makes it difficult to both efficiently utilize network resources and provide end-to-end network performance guarantees to the traffic sources.
Generally, smoothing or shaping traffic sources at the entrance of the network reduces their
burstiness to allow higher utilization within the network. However, this buffering introduces
an additional delay so that, in effect, lossless smoothing trades queueing delay inside the
network for smoothing delay at the network edge. In this paper, we consider the net effect
of smoothing on end-to-end performance guarantees where a no-loss, no-delay-violation deterministic guarantee is provided with the D-BIND traffic model. We analytically quantify
these tradeoffs and provide a set of general rules for determining under which conditions
smoothing provides a net gain. We also empirically investigate these tradeoffs using traces
of MPEG compressed video.

A result of Roquette [3] states that if D is an absolutely irreducible representation
of a p-group G over the field of complex numbers, then D can be realized in K((g) j
g 2 G), where is the character of D and K = Q or K = Q(i) according to whether
p 6= 2 or p = 2. Based on Baum and Clausen's [1] algorithm for computing the
irreducible representations of supersolvable groups, we give an elementary proof of a
theorem which, among other well-known facts on representations of p-groups, implies
Roquette's result.

Abstract
For slotted networks carrying full multi-media traffic to work successfully, it is essential that connection setup and management is done well under all traffic conditions.
Major challenges remain with the current state of the technology, however, particularly on how one copes with traffic bursts. Existing reservation-based networks do not
allow the user to dynamically adjust his bandwidth requirements on demand. In this
paper we propose a new scheme, called the reservoir scheme, which allows dynamic
and distributed resource allocation. The basic idea behind the scheme is to reserve
bandwidth with a guaranteed bit rate for each virtual circuit. The user is allowed to
decentrally allocate additional bandwidth from an Available Bit Rate (ABR) reservoir to satisfy dynamic changes of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic. The duration and
bandwidth of this dynamic access are negotiated in the call setup phase and do not
require any renegotiation with the service provider so that this solution overcomes the
rigidity of current static bandwidth reservation schemes. The additional management
requirements are low compared to other dynamic bandwidth reservation schemes. We
also describe an analytic model and simulation which we used to determine whether
it would be practical to apply the proposed scheme in a slotted network.

Abstract
We determine the computational complexity of deciding whether m polynomials in n variables have relatively prime leading terms with respect to some
term order. This problem is NP-complete in general, but solvable in polynomial time for m fixed and for nm fixed. Our new algorithm for the latter case
determines a candidate set of leading terms by solving a maximum matching
problem. This reduces the problem to linear programming.

Abstract
Technological progress has made providing numerous new services to large number
of users possible. Concurrently, we also experience an increased interest in real-time
and interactive applications, e. g. teleseminaring, video conferencing and application
sharing, in particular, because of the worldwide and decentralized character of today's
research and development organizations.
The International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) is a participant of the first
transatlantic ATM link which is an integral part of the Multimedia Applications
on Intercontinental Highways (MAY) Project. Additionally, ICSI is attached to the
Bay Area Gigabit Network (BAGNet) providing ATM connectivity at the best-effort
basis. Both projects provide platforms to identify the key research and development
topics in cooperative real-time communication.
The technical report gives a brief introduction to the ATM infrastructure at ICSI and
addresses challenging management issues of multimedia applications in such global
area ATM networks. We explore three management areas: performance, configuration,
and fault management with respect to the user's point of view. Finally, we introduce
a management platform and tools we have been developing which help the user to
better predict the quality of service provided and to recover from faults occurred in
the system or during a transmission.

Abstract
At the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), there is an ongoing effort
to gain experience on ATM and multi-media applications. ICSI is participating in
two ATM pilots called Bay Area Gigabit Network (BAGNet) and Multimedia Applications on Intercontinental Highway (MAY). Beside these wide-area trial ICSI's
ATM network is used for local multi-media experiments. The ATM environment at
ICSI is heterogeneous. Both, local and long distance traffic is based on permanent
virtual connections. The management of this environment has often been cumbersome and time-consuming for a number of reasons: The ATM devices have to be
accessed separately in an unintegrated manner. Different vendor-specific tools with
different user interfaces are used. Configuration data is stored unstructured, redundant and not centralized. Users cannot setup or verify a connection without knowing
device-specific details. Hence, the need for a software tool arose that can minimize the
administrative work spent on connection management. This technical report contains
my master's thesis which is about the design and implementation of TOMCAD a
tool for monitoring and configuration of ATM devices. Being a web-based software
tool it can support local and wide-area connectivity and provide access for local and
remote users.

Abstract. We use simulated soccer to study multiagent learning. Each
team's players (agents) share action set and policy but may behave differently due to position-dependent inputs. All agents making up a team
are rewarded or punished collectively in case of goals. We conduct simulations with varying team sizes, and compare two learning algorithms:
TD-Q learning with linear neural networks (TD-Q) and Probabilistic
Incremental Program Evolution (PIPE). TD-Q is based on evaluation
functions (EFs) mapping input/action pairs to expected reward, while
PIPE searches policy space directly. PIPE uses an adaptive probability
distribution to synthesize programs that calculate action probabilities
from current inputs. Our results show that TD-Q has difficulties to learn
appropriate shared EFs. PIPE, however, does not depend on EFs and
finds good policies faster and more reliably.

Abstract
Two key issues for induction algorithms are the accuracy of the learned hypothesis and the computational
resources consumed in inducing that hypothesis. One
of the most promising ways to improve performance
along both dimensions is to make use of additional
knowledge. Multi-strategy learning algorithms tackle
this problem by employing several strategies for handling different kinds of knowledge in different ways.
However, integrating knowledge into an induction algorithm can be difficult when the new knowledge differs significantly from the knowledge the algorithm
already uses. In many cases the algorithm must be
rewritten.
This paper presents KII, a Knowledge Integration
framework for Induction, that provides a uniform
mechanism for integrating knowledge into induction.
In theory, arbitrary knowledge can be integrated with
this mechanism, but in practice the knowledge representation language determines both the knowledge
that can be integrated, and the costs of integration
and induction. By instantiating KII with various set
representations, algorithms can be generated at different trade-off points along these dimensions.
One instantiation of KII, called RS-KII, is presented
that can implement hybrid induction algorithms, depending on which knowledge it utilizes. RS-KII is
demonstrated to implement AQ-11 (Michalski 1978),
as well as a hybrid algorithm that utilizes a domain
theory and noisy examples. Other algorithms are also
possible.

Abstract: A Hybrid Intelligent Architecture that aims to exploit the complementary features of
expert systems and connectionist architecture, is proposed to revise input characterization and initial
domain knowledge. HIA has two building blocks, a Rule-Based module and a Connectionist Architecture
module. A specific format for the rule-based description of the initial theory acquired from the application
domain enables its mapping into a uniform, three layer network. Continuous inputs are discretized into
input vectors using a new coarse coding scheme. An extension of the Backpropagation Algorithm allows
refinement of the discretization functions. A successful application to the control of dams on the Colorado
river near Austin, is described.

Abstract
Genetic Programming is applied to the task of
evolving general iterative sorting algorithms. A
connection between size and generality was discovered. Adding inverse size to the fitness measure along with correctness not only decreases
the size of the resulting evolved algorithms, but
also dramatically increases their generality and
thus the effectiveness of the evolution process. In
addition, a variety of differing problem formulations are investigated and the relative probability
of success for each is reported. An example of an
evolved sort from each problem formulation is
presented, and an initial attempt is made to
understand the variations in difficulty resulting
from these differing problem formulations.

A simple real-time garbage collection algorithm is presented which does not copy, thereby avoiding
some of the problems caused by the asynchronous motion of objects. This in-place "treadmill"
garbage collection scheme has approximately the same complexity as other nonmoving garbage
collectors, thus making it usable in a high-level language implementation where some pointers
cannot be traced. The treadmill is currently being used in a Lisp system built in Ada.

Abstract
Zero temperature Gibbs learning is considered for a connected committee machine
with K hidden units. For large K, the scale of the learning curve strongly depends
on the target rule. When learning a perceptron, the sample size P needed for optimal
generalization scales so that N t P t KN, where N is the dimension of the input.
This even holds for a noisy perceptron rule if a new input is classified by the majority
vote of all students in the version space. When learning a committee machine with M
hidden units, 1 t M t K, optimal generalization requires

Abstract
This paper describes an efficient optimistic concurrency control
scheme for use in distributed database systems in which objects are
cached and manipulated at client machines while persistent storage
and transactional support are provided by servers. The scheme
provides both serializability and external consistency for committed
transactions; it uses loosely synchronized clocks to achieve global
serialization. It stores only a single version of each object, and
avoids maintaining any concurrency control information on a per-
object basis; instead, it tracks recent invalidations on a per-client
basis, an approach that has low in-memory space overhead and no
per-object disk overhead. In addition to its low space overheads,
the scheme also performs well. The paper presents a simulation
study that compares the scheme to adaptive callback locking, the
best concurrency control scheme for client-server object-oriented
database systems studied to date. The study shows that our
scheme outperforms adaptive callback locking for low to moderate
contention workloads, and scales better with the number of clients.
For high contention workloads, optimism can result in a high abort
rate; the scheme presented here is a first step toward a hybrid scheme
that we expect to perform well across the full range of workloads.

Abstract
A non-greedy approach for constructing globally optimal
multivariate decision trees with fixed structure is proposed. Previous greedy tree construction algorithms are
locally optimal in that they optimize some splitting criterion at each decision node, typically one node at a time.
In contrast, global tree optimization explicitly considers
all decisions in the tree concurrently. An iterative linear
programming algorithm is used to minimize the classification error of the entire tree. Global tree optimization
can be used both to construct decision trees initially and
to update existing decision trees. Encouraging computational experience is reported.

Generating language that reflects the temporal organization of represented knowledge requires a language generation model that integrates contemporary theories of tense and aspect, temporal representations, and methods
to plan text. This paper presents a model
that produces complex sentences that reflect
temporal relations present in underlying temporal concepts. The main result of this work
is the successful application of constrained linguistic theories of tense and aspect to a generator which produces meaningful event combinations and selects appropriate connecting words
that relate them.

Abstract. In this paper we present one aspect of our research on machine translation (MT):
capturing the grammatical and computational relation between (i) the interlingua (IL) as defined
declaratively in the lexicon and (ii) the IL as defined procedurally by way of algorithms that
compose and decompose pivot IL forms. We begin by examining the interlinguas in the lexicons of
a variety of current IL-based approaches to MT. This brief survey makes it clear that no consensus
exists among MT researchers on the level of representation for defining the IL. In the section that
follows, we explore the consequences of this missing formal framework for MT system builders who
develop their own lexical-IL entries. The lack of software tools to support rapid IL respecification
and testing greatly hampers their ability to modify representations to handle new data and new
domains. Our view is that IL-based MT research needs both (a) the formal framework to specify
possible IL grammars and (b) the software support tools to implement and test these grammars.
With respect to (a), we propose adopting a lexicalized grammar approach, tapping research
results from the study of tree grammars for natural language syntax. With respect to (b), we
sketch the design and functional specifications for parts of ILustrate, the set of software tools
that we need to implement and test the various IL formalisms that meet the requirements of a
lexicalized grammar. In this way, we begin to address a basic issue in MT research, how to define
and test an interlingua as a computational language | without building a full MT system for
each possible IL formalism that might be proposed.

Abstract. The application of Machine Learning techniques to multimedia and multimodal systems,
resp., seems to be a promising approach in order to enhance the systems' capabilities. Especially
in multimodal systems which support human-computer interaction (HCI) via several input/output
channels in parallel, intelligent mechanisms are needed in order to process the user's inputs and to
select the best output modality.
In this paper, we will deal with a multi-agent system which introduces some kind of haptic feedback
to the user interface. The main task of the system is to predict the next user action in order to launch
the haptic feedback selectively and to adapt this capability over time to both, the user's behavior
and the application's user interface structure. Therefore, a statistical interaction model is generated
and managed based on stochastic classification methods.

Abstract
The problem of scheduling two classes of real-time traffic with correlated time constraints
is considered. Three scheduling disciplines are studied: a priority discipline which gives strict
priority to one class of traffic, a threshold-based scheme in which priority is given to one class
of traffic when the minimum laxity of its queued packets falls below some threshold, and a
"balancing" scheme which assigns priority on the basis of the differences in minimum laxities in
the two classes of traffic. Analytic results are obtained by using a discrete time model to obtain
the state occupancy probabilities for the system. Here, the state is defined using the laxities of
the queued real time packets. Parameters are defined to study the tradeoff in the performance
of the two classes of traffic. Results are obtained to demonstrate how the balancing scheme
permits us to achieve significant improvement in the performance of one class of traffic with
only minimal effect on the performance of other class. A video application is suggested for this
work.

Abstract
Techniques for avoiding the high memory overheads found on
many modern shared-memory multiprocessors are of increasing
importance in the development of high-performance multiprocessor protocol implementations. One such technique is processor-cache affinity scheduling, which can significantly lower packet
latency and substantially increase protocol processing throughput
[20]. In this paper, we evaluate several aspects of the effectiveness of affinity-based scheduling in multiprocessor network
protocol processing, under packet-level and connection-level par-allelization approaches. Specifically, we evaluate the performance
of the scheduling technique 1) when a large number of streams are
concurrently supported, 2) when processing includes copying of
uncached packet data, 3) as applied to send-side protocol processing, and 4) in the presence of stream burstiness and source locality, two well-known properties of network traffic. We find that
affinity-based scheduling performs well under these conditions,
emphasizing its robustness and general effectiveness in multiprocessor network processing. In addition, we explore a technique
which improves the caching behavior and available packet-level
concurrency under connection-level parallelism, and find performance improves dramatically.

Abstract
The loss probability of a queueing system provides, in many cases, insufficient information for performance evaluation, for example, of data link layer protocols and applications with forward
error correction.
This paper evaluates and characterizes the correlation between packet losses for two queueing systems in discrete time
that are motivated by BISDN applications. The first, a two-class discrete-time queueing system, approximates the output
queue of an ATM switch. The queue serves periodic foreground
traffic and random background traffic. The background traffic
is modeled as i.i.d. batches of arbitrary distribution. It is shown
that the conditional loss probability (CLP) is independent of the
buffer size if the buffer size is at least as large as the period of
the foreground traffic. Example calculations indicate that losses
occur essentially randomly as long as the foreground traffic uses
less than 10% of the channel capacity.
The second analysis derives the CLP seen by a selected
stream in a slotted finite-buffer system with a superposition of
interrupted Poisson sources. Here, the total number of arrivals
may be correlated from slot to slot. Traffic correlation is seen
to have a strong influence on loss correlation, while buffer size
is seen to have virtually none.

Abstract
VBR compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple-time-scale bit rate variability. In this paper, we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a
high speed network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most effectively toward
reducing the variability of the transmitted bit rate.
We present two basic results. First, we show how to achieve the greatest possible reduction in
rate variability when sending stored video to a client with given buffer size. We formally establish
the optimality of our optimal smoothing approach, and illustrate its performance over a set of
long MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing on the
network resources needed for video transport, under two network service models: Deterministic
Guaranteed service [1, 11] and Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service [9, 8]. Under both models, we
find the impact of optimal smoothing to be dramatic.

Abstract. Domain or background knowledge is often needed in order
to solve difficult problems of learning medical diagnostic rules. Earlier
experiments have demonstrated the utility of background knowledge
when learning rules for early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases. A particular form of background knowledge comprising typical co-occurrences
of several groups of attributes was provided by a medical expert. This
paper explores the possibility to automate the process of acquiring background knowledge of this kind. A method based on function decomposition is proposed that identifies typical co-occurrences for a given set
of attributes. The method is evaluated by comparing the typical co-occurrences it identifies, as well as their contribution to the performance
of machine learning algorithms, to the ones provided by a medical expert.

Abstract
Massively parallel processors have begun using commodity operating systems that support demand-paged
virtual memory. To evaluate the utility of virtual
memory, we measured the behavior of seven shared-memory parallel application programs on a simulated
distributed-shared-memory machine. Our results (i)
confirm the importance of gang CPU scheduling, (ii)
show that a page-faulting processor should spin rather
than invoke a parallel context switch, (iii) show that
our parallel programs frequently touch most of their
data, and (iv) indicate that memory, not just CPUs,
must be "gang scheduled". Overall, our experiments
demonstrate that demand paging has limited value
on current parallel machines because of the applications' synchronization and memory reference patterns
and the machines' high page-fault and parallel-context-switch overheads.

Abstract
This paper describes how a runtime support library can be used as compiler runtime
support in irregular applications. The CHAOS runtime support library carries out
optimizations designed to reduce communication costs by performing software caching,
communication coalescing and inspector/executor preprocessing. CHAOS also supplies
special purpose routines to support specific types of irregular reduction and runtime
support for partitioning data and work between processors. A number of adaptive
irregular codes have been parallelized using the CHAOS library and performance results
from these codes are also presented in this paper.

Abstract
This paper presents methods that make it possible to efficiently support irregular problems using data
parallel languages. The approach involves the use of a portable, compiler-independent, runtime support
library called CHAOS. The CHAOS runtime support library contains procedures that
* support static and dynamic distributed array partitioning,
* partition loop iterations and indirection arrays,
* remap arrays from one distribution to another, and
* carry out index translation, buffer allocation and communication schedule generation.
The CHAOS runtime procedures are used by a prototype Fortran 90D compiler as runtime support for irregular problems. This paper also presents performance results of compiler-generated and
hand-parallelized versions of two stripped down applications codes. The first code is derived from
an unstructured mesh computational fluid dynamics flow solver and the second is derived from the
molecular dynamics code CHARMM.
A method is described that makes it possible to emulate irregular distributions in HPF by reordering elements of data arrays and renumbering indirection arrays. The results suggest that an HPF
compiler could use reordering and renumbering extrinsic functions to obtain performance comparable
to that achieved by a compiler for a language (such as Fortran 90D) that directly supports irregular
distributions.

A number of methods are presented for highly efficient calculation
of substrate current transport. A three-dimensionalGreen's Function
based substrate representation, in combination with the use of the
Fast Fourier Transform, significantly speeds up the computation of
sensitivities with respect to all parameters associated with a given
architecture. Substrate sensitivity analysis is used in a number of
physical optimization tools, such as placement and trend analysis for
the estimation of the impact of technology migration and/or layout
re-design.

This paper presents the overall structure of PAPIA2, a pyramid
system belonging to the family of massive parallel machines. It embeds
the topology of the quad-pyramid into a highly regular, fault tolerant,
eight-connected proces sor array by means of specially reconfigurable
near-neighbor interconnections. The system comes with a fully-fledged
software environment designed to optimize the use of machine resources.
The highly interactive graphic tools help in understanding the machine's
capabilities, provide a valuable testbed for the machine instruction set,
and offer a suitable context for monitoring program execution.

Abstract
The concept of a fitness formula as a property of an organism is proposed. In
artificial life simulations with organisms living in an environment, the fitness formula
can be interpreted as the ability of organisms to extract energy from potential food
sources distributed in the environment. In simulations where the goal of the genetic
algorithm is that of developing systems which exhibit a certain type of behavior in a
particular environment, the fitness formula becomes an independent variable which can
be manipulated in order to obtain the desired behavior. The fitness formula can be
viewed as an evolvable trait of organisms, and therefore not fixed and decided by the
researcher. Simulations with fixed and evolvable fitness formulae show that the fitness
formula, the sensory apparatus, and the behavior of organisms may co-evolve and be
co-adapted.

as a systemic approach to the modeling and support of knowledge processes in a
learning society. This article addresses the rationale for, and systemic foundations of,
the learning web, its implications for restructuring the higher education system, and
the role of information technology in supporting that restructuring. Two associated
articles report on the implementation of some of the technologies necessary to
support the learning web [Gaines and Shaw, 1996], and some preliminary experience
in applying them in undergraduate education [Shaw and Gaines, 1996].

Abstract
This paper advocates the idea that the physical modularity (file structure) of application components supported by conventional OS environments can be elevated to the level of logical modularity, which in turn
can directly support application development in an
object-oriented manner. We demonstrate this idea
through a system-wide server that manages the manipulation of such components effectively. The server
is designed to be a fundamental operating system service responsible for binding and mapping component
instances into client address spaces.
We show how this model solves some longstanding
problems with the management of application components in existing application development environments. We demonstrate that this model's effectiveness derives from its support for the cornerstones of
OO programming: classes and their instances, encapsulation, and several forms of inheritance.

Abstract
In this paper we introduce a general method for Bayesian computing in richly-parameterized
models, Structured Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC), that is based on a blocked hybrid of the
Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. SMCMC speeds algorithm convergence by
using the structure that is present in the problem to suggest an appropriate Metropolis-Hastings
candidate distribution. While the approach is easiest to describe for hierarchical normal linear
models, we show its extension to both non-normal and nonlinear cases to be straightforward.
After describing the method in detail we compare its performance (both in terms of runtime and
autocorrelation in the samples produced) to several other existing methods, including the traditional
single-site updating Gibbs sampler available in the popular BUGS software package. Our results
suggest significant improvements in convergence for many problems using SMCMC, as well as
broad applicability of the method, including previously intractable hierarchical nonlinear model
settings.

Abstract
Most of the solutions proposed to support real-time (i.e. guaranteed performance) communication services in packet-switching networks adopt a connection-oriented and reservation-oriented approach. In such an approach, resource allocation
and route selection decisions are made before the start of the communication on the basis of resource availability and real-time network load at that time, and are usually kept for the duration of the communication. This rather static resource
management approach has certain limitations: it does not take into account (a) the dynamics of the communicating clients;
(b) the dynamics of the network state; and (c) the tradeoff between quality of service and network availability, thus affecting
the availability and flexibility of the real-time network services. Availability is the ability of the network to accommodate
as many real-time clients as possible, while flexibility is the ability to adapt the real-time services to changing network state
and client demands. In this paper, we present the Dynamic Connection Management (DCM) scheme, which addresses these
issues by providing the network with the capability to dynamically modify the performance parameters and the routes of
any existing real-time connection. With these capabilities, DCM can be used to increase the availability and flexibility of
the guaranteed performance service offered to the clients.

Abstract
We examine the estimation of selectivities for range and spatial join queries in real spatial
databases. As we have shown earlier [FK94a], real point sets: (a) violate consistently the
"uniformity" and "independence" assumptions, (b) can often be described as "fractals", with
non-integer (fractal) dimension. In this paper we show that, among the infinite family of fractal
dimensions, the so called "Correlation Dimension" D 2 is the one that we need to predict the
selectivity of spatial join.
The main contribution is that, for all the real and synthetic point-sets we tried, the average
number of neighbors for a given point of the point-set follows a power law, with D 2 as the exponent. This immediately solves the selectivity estimation for spatial joins, as well as for "biased"
range queries (i.e., queries whose centers prefer areas of high point density).
We present the formulas to estimate the selectivity for the biased queries, including an integration constant (K `shape 0 ) for each query shape. Finally, we show results on real and synthetic
point sets, where our formulas achieve very low relative errors (typically about 10%, versus
40%-100% of the uniform assumption).

Probabilistic Independence Networks for Hidden
Markov Probability Models
//author
Padhraic Smyth , David Heckerman , and Michael Jordan
A<abstract> bstract
Graphical techniques for modeling the dependencies of random variables have been explored in a variety
of different areas including statistics, statistical physics, artificial intelligence, speech recognition, image
processing, and genetics. Formalisms for manipulating these models have been developed relatively
independently in these research communities. In this paper we explore hidden Markov models (HMMs)
and related structures within the general framework of probabilistic independence networks (PINs). The
paper contains a self-contained review of the basic principles of PINs. It is shown that the well-known
forward-backward (F-B) and Viterbi algorithms for HMMs are special cases of more general inference
algorithms for arbitrary PINs. Furthermore, the existence of inference and estimation algorithms for
more general graphical models provides a set of analysis tools for HMM practitioners who wish to explore
a richer class of HMM structures. Examples of relatively complex models to handle sensor fusion and
coarticulation in speech recognition are introduced and treated within the graphical model framework
to illustrate the advantages of the general approach.

Networks and the Best Approximation Property
//author
Federico Girosi and Tomaso Poggio
//abstract
Abstract
Networks can be considered as approximation schemes. Multilayer networks of the
backpropagation type can approximate arbitrarily well continuous functions (Cybenko,
1989; Funahashi, 1989; Stinchcombe and White, 1989). We prove that networks derived from regularization theory and including Radial Basis Functions (Poggio and
Girosi, 1989), have a similar property. From the point of view of approximation theory, however, the property of approximating continuous functions arbitrarily well is not
sufficient for characterizing good approximation schemes. More critical is the property
of best approximation. The main result of this paper is that multilayer networks, of the
type used in backpropagation, are not best approximation. For regularization networks
(in particular Radial Basis Function networks) we prove existence and uniqueness of
best approximation.

Abstract
Programmers using imperative languages have a number of well-established debugging tools available to them; functional programmers have few, if any, tools available.
Many of the tools and techniques developed for debugging functional programs are
based on those for imperative programming and lack a theoretical basis relevant to
functional programming. In addition, the techniques used are typically very time-consuming. A theoretical foundation on which to base the study of errors and debugging in functional programming is presented in this report. Using this theoretical
foundation, a set of program transformation schemes has been developed which facilitate the location of the type of error which results in an evaluation-time error message
and the termination of evaluation. A brief description of the practical experience ob
tained using the tool is also presented.

ABSTRACT
Communication in real-time systems has to be predictable, because unpredictable delays in
the delivery of messages can adversely affect the execution of tasks dependent on these messages.
In this paper, we develop a scheme for providing predictable inter-process communication in
real-time systems with (partially connected) point-to-point interconnection networks, which
provides guarantees on the maximum delivery time for messages. This scheme is based on the
concept of a real-time channel, a unidirectional connection between source and destination. A
real-time channel has parameters which describe the performance requirements of the source-destination communication, e.g., from a sensor station to a control site. Once such a channel
is established, the communications subsystem guarantees that these performance requirements
will be met. In this paper, we concentrate on methods to compute guarantees for the delivery time of messages belonging to real-time channels. We also address problems associated
with allocating buffers for these messages and develop a scheme which preserves delivery time
guarantees.

Abstract
Designers of embedded systems are facing ever tighter
constraints on design time, but computer aided design tools
for embedded systems have not kept pace with these trends.
The Chinook co-synthesis system addresses the automation of the most time-consuming and error-prone tasks in
embedded controller design, namely: the synthesis of interface hardware and software needed to integrate system
components; the migration of functions between processors
or custom logic; and the co-simulation of the design before,
during, and after synthesis. This paper describes the principal elements of Chinook and discuss its application to a
variety of embedded designs.

Dispersion Analysis of Numerical Wave Propagation
and its Computational Consequences
//author
Alain Sei and William Symes
//note
(Submitted to the Journal of Scientific Computing)
//abstract
Abstract
We present in this paper a comparison of the dispersion properties for several finite-difference approximations of the acoustic wave equation. We investigate the compact and
staggered schemes of fourth order accuracy in space and of second order or fourth order accuracy in time. We derive the computational cost of the simulation implied by a precision
criterion on the numerical simulation (maximum allowed error in phase or group velocity).
We conclude that for moderate accuracy the staggered scheme of second order in time is more
efficient, whereas for very precise simulation the compact scheme of fourth order in time is
a better choice. The comparison increasingly favors the lower order staggered scheme as the
dimension increases. In three dimensional simulation, the cost of extremely precise simulation with any of the schemes is very large, whereas for simulation of moderate precision the
staggered scheme is the least expensive.

Abstract
We analyze a space-time domain decomposition iteration, for a model advection
diffusion equation in one and two dimensions. The asymptotic convergence rate is
superlinear, and it is governed by the diffusion of the error across the overlap between
subdomains. Hence, it depends on both the size of this overlap and the diffusion
coefficient in the equation. However, it is independent of the number of subdomains.
The convergence rate for the heat equation in a large time window is initially linear and
it deteriorates as the number of subdomains increases. The duration of the transient
linear regime is proportional to the length of the time window. For advection dominated
problems, the convergence rate is initially linear and it improves as the the ratio of
advection to diffusion increases. Moreover, it is independent of the size of the time
window and of the number of subdomains. In two space dimensions, the iteration
possesses the smoothing property: high modes of the error are damped much faster
then low modes. This is a result of the natural smoothing property of the heat equation.
Numerical calculations illustrate our analysis.

ABSTRACT
This paper discusses a method for training multilayer
perceptron networks called DMP2 (Dynamic Multilayer
Perceptron 2). The method is based upon a divide and conquer
approach which builds networks in the form of binary trees,
dynamically allocating nodes and layers as needed. The focus
of this paper is on the effects of using multiple node types
within the DMP framework. Simulation results show that
DMP2 performs favorably in comparison with other learning
algorithms, and that using multiple node types can be
beneficial to network performance.

Abstract. This paper presents an inductive learning system called the Genetic Instance-Based
Learning (GIBL) system. This system combines instance-based learning approaches with
evolutionary computation in order to achieve high accuracy in the presence of irrelevant or
redundant attributes. Evolutionary computation is used to find a set of attribute weights that
yields a high estimate of classification accuracy. Results of experiments on 16 data sets are
shown, and are compared with a non-weighted version of the instance-based learning system.
The results indicate that the generalization accuracy of GIBL is somewhat higher than that of the
non-weighted system on regular data, and is significantly higher on data with irrelevant or
redundant attributes.

Incremental Cryptography and Application to Virus Protection
//author
Mihir Bellare Oded Goldreich Shafi Goldwasser
//abstract
Abstract
The goal of incremental cryptography is to design cryptographic algorithms with the property that having applied
the algorithm to a document, it is possible to quickly update
the result of the algorithm for a modified document, rather
than having to re-compute it from scratch. In settings where
cryptographic algorithms such as encryption or signatures
are frequently applied to changing documents, dramatic efficiency improvements can be achieved. One such setting is
the use of authentication tags for virus protection.
We consider documents that can be modified by powerful (and realistic) document modification operations such as
insertion and deletion of character-strings (or equivalently
cut and paste of text). We provide efficient incremental
signature and message authentication schemes supporting
the above document modification operations. They meet a
strong notion of tamper-proof security which is appropriate
for the virus protection setting. We initiate a study of incremental encryption, providing definitions as well as solutions.
Finally, we raise the novel issue of "privacy" of incremental
authentication schemes.

On Yao's XOR-Lemma

//abstract
Abstract
A fundamental Lemma of Yao states that computational weak-unpredictability
of functions gets amplified if the results of several independent instances are XOR
together. We survey two known proofs of Yao's Lemma and present a third alternative proof. The third proof proceeds by first proving that a function constructed
by concatenating the values of the function on several independent instances is much
more unpredictable, with respect to specified complexity bounds, than the original
function. This statement turns out to be easier to prove than the XOR-Lemma.
Using a result of Goldreich and Levin and some elementary observation, we derive
the XOR-Lemma.

Eventually-Serializable Data Services
//author
Alan Fekete David Gupta Victor Luchangco Nancy Lynch Alex Shvartsman
//abstract
Abstract
We present a new specification for distributed data services that trade-off immediate consistency guarantees
for improved system availability and efficiency, while
ensuring the long-term consistency of the data. An
eventually-serializable data service maintains the operations requested in a partial order that gravitates over
time towards a total order. It provides clear and unambiguous guarantees about the immediate and long-term
behavior of the system. To demonstrate its utility, we
present an algorithm, based on one of Ladin, Liskov,
Shrira, and Ghemawat [12], that implements this specification. Our algorithm provides the interface of the
abstract service, and generalizes their algorithm by allowing general operations and greater flexibility in specifying consistency requirements. We also describe how
to use this specification as a building block for applications such as directory services.

Proactive RSA
//author
Yair Frankel Peter Gemmell Philip D. MacKenzie Moti Yung x
//date
August 4, 1996
//abstract
Abstract
The notion of "proactive security" of basic primitives and cryptosystems that are distributed
amongst various servers, was introduced in order to tolerate a very strong "mobile adversary." This
adversary may corrupt all participants throughout the lifetime of the system in a non-monotonic
fashion (i.e. recoveries are possible) but the adversary is unable to corrupt too many participants
during any short time period [OstrovskyYung]. The notion assures increased security and availability
of the cryptographic primitive.
We present a proactive RSA system in which a threshold of servers applies the RSA signature
(or decryption) function in a distributed manner; RSA is perhaps the most important trapdoor
function in use. Employing new combinatorial and elementary number theoretic techniques, our
protocol enables the dynamic updating of the servers (which hold the RSA key distributively);
it is secure even when a linear number of the servers are corrupted during any time period (linear
redundancy); it efficiently "self-maintains" the security of the function and its messages (ciphertexts
or signatures); and it enables continuous availability, namely, correct function application using the
shared key is possible at any time.
We present an efficient way in which l servers can share an RSA private function so that, given
0 &lt; &lt; t &lt; 1:
* Proactive (Dynamic) Robustness: A gateway G can combine information from any set of lt
(honest) servers to deduce the RSA signature for any authorized message at any period.
* Proactive Security (against mobile adversary): Our protocol is secure against a polynomial
time adversary who controls the gateway G and time-variant sets of up to minfl(1 t ); lg
servers, and can obtain the shares of up to l servers (including those that it corrupts).
* Uniform Boundedness: The share-size is always bounded by the size of an RSA private key
(i.e., logarithmically in N ).
We also present special practical instances based on designs; some of these instances were recently
implemented as part of a highly secure application testbed at Sandia National Laboratories.
A major technical difficulty in "proactivizing" RSA was the fact that the servers have to update
the "distributed representation" of an RSA key, while not learning the order of the group from
which keys are drawn (in order not to compromise the RSA security).

Abstract
A unified, comprehensive presentation of simulation techniques for verification of concurrent systems is given, in terms of a simple untimed automaton model. In particular,
(1) refinements, (2) forward and backward simulations, (3) hybrid forward-backward
and backward-forward simulations, and (4) history and prophecy relations are defined.
History and prophecy relations are abstract versions of the history and prophecy variables of Abadi and Lamport, as well as the auxiliary variables of Owicki and Gries.
Relationships between the different types of simulations, as well as soundness and
completeness results, are stated and proved. Finally, it is shown how invariants can be
incorporated into all the simulations.
Even though many results are presented here for the first time, this paper can
also be read as a survey (in a simple setting) of the research literature on simulation
techniques.
The development for untimed automata is designed to support a similar development for timed automata. In Part II of this paper, it is shown how the results of this
paper can be carried over to the setting of timed automata.

//abstract
Abstract
Previous efforts at facial expression recognition have
been based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a
representation developed in order to allow human psychologists to code expression from static facial mugshots. In
this paper we develop new, more accurate representations
for facial expression by building a video database of facial
expressions and then probabilistically characterizing the
facial muscle activation associated with each expression
using a detailed physical model of the skin and muscles.
This produces a muscle-based representation of facial motion, which is then used to recognize facial expressions in
two different ways. The first method uses the physics-based
model directly, by recognizing expressions through comparison of estimated muscle activations. The second method
uses the physics-based model to generate spatio-temporal
motion-energy templates of the whole face for each different
expression. These simple, biologically-plausible motion
energy templates are then used for recognition. Both
methods show substantially greater accuracy at expression
recognition than has been previously achieved.

Abstract
A thesaurus is a book containing synonyms in a
given language; it provides similarity links when
trying to retrieve articles or stories about a particular topic. A "visual thesaurus" works with
pictures, not words. It aids in recognizing visually similar events, "visual synonyms," including
both spatial and motion similarity. This paper
describes a method for building such a tool, and
recent research results in the MIT Media Lab
which contribute toward this goal. The heart
of the method is a learning system which gathers information by interacting with a user of a
database. The learning system is also capable of
incorporating audio and other perceptual information, ultimately constructing a representation
of common sense knowledge.

Abstract
We propose a person identification technique that
can recognize and verify people from unconstrained
video and audio. We do not expect fully frontal face
image or clean speech as our input. Our recognition algorithm can detect and compensate for pose variation
and changes in the auditory background and also select the most reliable video frame and audio clip to use
for recognition. We also use 3D depth information of
a human head to detect the presence of an actual person as opposed to an image of that person. Our system achieves 100% recognition and verification rates
on natural real-time input with 26 registered clients.

Building Query Optimizers with Combinators:
//note
Dissertation Proposal
//author
Mitch Cherniack
//abstract
Abstract
Query optimizers generate plans to retrieve data specified by queries. Query optimization
for object databases (i.e., object-oriented and object-relational databases) is an immature field,
and stands to benefit from adaptation of techniques that have proved useful for relations. One
technique uses query-to-query transformations to rewrite queries into queries that are potentially
more amenable to plan generation. For transformations to be useful, they must preserve the
semantics of the queries they rewrite (correctness) and usually result in queries that generate
better plans (effectiveness). Object databases complicate the expression of correct and effective
transformations.
Transformation correctness is problematic even for relational queries. Especially error-prone
are transformations that rewrite complex nested queries (queries containing other queries) or
queries that return duplicates. Objects make correctness more difficult because object queries
can be far more complex than relational queries.
The effectiveness of a relational transformation typically depends on the syntax of a query
rather than the semantics of of its data or functions. On the other hand, the lack of uniformity
in data functions and collections in an object query makes effectiveness more subtle. The effectiveness of a transformation for object queries may depend on the semantics of data functions,
and may vary from object to object in a collection. Therefore, optimizers may have to perform
sophisticated reasoning and apply transformations on a per object basis to ensure that they are
used only when appropriate.
This thesis considers the correctness and effectiveness of optimizer transformations. To
address correctness, we propose a formally specified query algebra and two-tiered language
(COKO-KOLA) for expressing transformations that can be verified with a theorem prover. To
address effectiveness, we propose semantic and dynamic extensions to the traditional optimizer
architecture. The high-level contribution of the thesis is the observation that the choice of
query representation impacts the quality of the optimizer. Specifically, a combinator-based
(variable-free) query representation simplifies the query manipulations that are required to make
transformations correct and effective.

Abstract
Shape recognition is a challenging task when images contain overlapping, noisy, occluded, partial shapes.
This paper addresses the task of matching input shapes with model shapes described in terms of features
such as line segments and angles. The quality of matching is gauged using a measure derived from attributed
shape grammars. We apply genetic algorithms to the partial shape-matching task. Preliminary results, using
model shapes with 6 to 70 features each, are extremely encouraging.

This paper presents some of the underlying principles of description logics (also known
as terminological logics or kl-one-style languages), grounding them in the lattice of terms
organized by the so-called "subsumption" relationship. A survey of the increasingly varied uses
of description logics, including industrial applications, is presented by considering their role in
a number of different operations that one can apply to a knowledge base, including languages
for queries, answers, updates, rules, and constraints. Finally, we discuss some of the complexity
results related to the logics of descriptions, and survey a spectrum of responses to the many
intractability proofs.

Abstract
This paper presents an efficient algorithm for constructing Bayesian belief networks from databases. The
algorithm takes a database and an attributes ordering (i.e., the causal attributes of an attribute should appear earlier
in the order) as input and constructs a belief network structure as output. The construction process is based on the
computation of mutual information of attribute pairs. Given a data set which is large enough and has a DAG-Isomorphic probability distribution, this algorithm guarantees that the perfect map [1] of the underlying dependency
model is generated, and at the same time, enjoys the time complexity of O N( ) 2 on conditional independence (CI)
tests. To evaluate this algorithm, we present the experimental results on three versions of the well-known ALARM
network database, which has 37 attributes and 10,000 records. The correctness proof and the analysis of
computational complexity are also presented. We also discuss the features of our work and relate it to previous
works.

Abstract
Large-scale parallel machines are incorporating increasingly sophisticated architectural support for user-level messaging and global memory access. We provide a systematic
evaluation of a broad spectrum of current design alternatives
based on our implementations of a global address language
on the Thinking Machines CM-5, Intel Paragon, Meiko CS-2, Cray T3D, and Berkeley NOW. This evaluation includes
a range of compilation strategies that make varying use of
the network processor; each is optimized for the target architecture and the particular strategy. We analyze a family
of interacting issues that determine the performance tradeoffs in each implementation, quantify the resulting latency,
overhead, and bandwidth of the global access operations,
and demonstrate the effects on application performance.

An Improved Algorithm for Performance Optimal Technology
Mapping with Retiming in LUT-Based FPGA Design

//abstract
Abstract
A novel algorithm, named SeqMapII, of technology
mapping with retiming for optimal clock period for K-LUT based FPGAs was recently proposed by Pan and
Liu [13]. The time complexity of their algorithm, however, is O(K 3 n 4 log(Kn 2 ) log n) for sequential circuits
with n gates, which is too high for medium and large
size designs in practice. In this paper, we present
three strategies to improve the performance of the approach in [13]: 1) efficient label update with single
K-cut computation based on the monotone property
of labels that we showed for sequential circuits, 2) a
novel approach for the K-cut computation on partial
flow networks, which are much smaller in practice, 3)
SCC (strongly connected component) partition to further speedup the algorithm. In practice, our algorithm
works in O(K 2 n 3 log n) time and O(Kn) space according to our experimental results. It is 2fi10 4 times faster
than SeqMapII-opt for computing optimal solutions and
2 times faster than SeqMapII-heu which uses very small
expanded circuits as a heuristic.

Abstract
An extended visual cryptography scheme, EVCS for short, for an access structure
( Qual ; Forb ) on a set of n participants, is a technique to encode n images in such a
way that when we stack together the transparencies associated to participants in any
set X 2 Qual we get the secret message with no trace of the original images, but any
X 2 Forb has no information on the shared image. Moreover, after the original images
are encoded they are still meaningful, that is, any user will recognize the image on his
transparency.
The main contributions of this paper are the following:
* A trade-off between the contrast of the reconstructed image and the contrast of the
image on each transparency for (k; k)-threshold EVCS (in a (k; k)-threshold EVCS
the image is visible if and only if k transparencies are stacked together). This yields
a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of (k; k)-threshold EVCS for
the values of such contrasts. In case a scheme exists we explicitly construct it.
* A general technique to implement extended visual cryptography schemes, which
uses hypergraph colourings. This technique yields (k; k)-threshold EVCS which
are optimal with respect to the pixel expansion. Finally, we discuss some applications of this technique to various interesting classes of access structures by using
relevant results from the theory of hypergraph colourings.

Abstract
The FAA Aging Aircraft Research Program is
supporting the development of a robotic mobile
nondestructive inspection (NDI) instrument
deployment tool at Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU) with the active participation of USAir. The
program has spawned several new relationships
and entities: an alliance with an ARPA-funded
research program at CMU having the capability to
add 3D-stereoscopic enhanced visual inspection
capability, a start-up company organized to
commercialize the combined technologies, and
State of Pennsylvania funding to foster this
commercialization. As a result of these activities
and connections the civilian sector appears to be
ahead of the military sector in important aspects of
automation for deployment of aircraft inspection
equipment. A partnership between the university
researchers, the airline operator, the start-up
company, and the state government is thus
emerging as the likely agent for transfer of the
civilian-developed technology to the military sector.

Abstract
This paper describes automatic document categorization based on large text hierarchy. We
handle the large number of features and training examples by taking into account hierarchical
structure of examples and using feature selection for large text data. We experimentally evaluate
feature subset selection on real-world text data collected from the existing Web hierarchy named
Yahoo. In our learning experiments naive Bayesian classifier was used on text data using feature-vector document representation that includes word sequences (n-grams) instead of just single words
(unigrams). Experimental evaluation on real-world data collected form the Web shows that our
approach gives promising results and can potentially be used for document categorization on the
Web. Additionally the best result on our data is achieved for relatively small feature subset, while for
larger subset the performance substantially drops. The best performance among six tested feature
scoring measure was achieved by the feature scoring measure called Odds ratio that is known from
information retrieval.

Abstract
Access to shared data is provided today by distributed file systems and
databases. In this paper, we explore certain usage and technological trends that
will radically change the way shared data is used in the future. The usage trends
include the growing need to access shared data from anywhere, increasing scale,
and the increasing importance of efficient search. The technology trends include
the advent of portable machines, the availability of software and hardware for
using diverse types of data, and the growing diversity of network speeds and
capabilities. These trends induce fundamental research problems in the areas of
adaptive system behavior, secure remote execution and extensibility.

Abstract
In this paper we show that application-aware adaptation, a
collaborative partnership between the operating system and
applications, offers the most general and effective approach
to mobile information access. We describe the design of
Odyssey, a prototype implementing this approach, and show
how it supports concurrent execution of diverse mobile applications. We identify agility as a key attribute of adaptive systems, and describe how to quantify and measure it.
We present the results of our evaluation of Odyssey, indicating performance improvements up to a factor of 5 on a
benchmark of three applications concurrently using remote
services over a network with highly variable bandwidth.

ABSTRACT
We present recent advances from our efforts in increasing coverage, robustness, generality and speed of JANUS, CMU's
speech-to-speech translation system. JANUS is a speaker-independent system which translates spoken utterances in
English and also in German into one of German, English or
Japanese. The system has been designed around the task
of conference registration (CR). It has initially been built
based on a speech database of 12 read dialogs, encompassing a vocabulary of around 500 words. We have since been
expanding the system along several dimensions to improve
speed, robustness and coverage and to move toward spontaneous input.

Abstract
AURORA is a vision-based system designed to warn a vehicle driver of possible impending roadway departure accidents. It employs a downward looking color video camera with a wide angle
lens, a digitizer, and a portable Sun Sparc workstation. Using a binormalized adjustable template
correlation algorithm, it reliably detects lane markers on structured roads at 60 Hz. A time-to-lane-crossing (TLC) measurement is calculated for each image based on the estimation of vehicles lateral position and velocity. This measurement is used to trigger an alarm when the TLC falls below
a preset threshold. Promising results have been achieved under a variety of weather and lighting
conditions, on many road types.

A Combinatorial Approach to Trajectory Planning for Binary
Manipulators

//abstract
Abstract
Binary manipulators are powered by actuators
which have only two stable states. Therefore, they
can reach only a discrete (but possibly large) number
of locations. Compared to a manipulator built with
continuous actuators, a binary manipulator provides
reasonable performance, and is relatively inexpensive
(up to an order of magnitude cheaper). The number
of states of a binary manipulator grows exponentially
with the number of actuators. This makes the calculation of its inverse kinematics quite difficult. This
paper presents a combinatorial method for computing
the inverse kinematics of a binary manipulator that
reduces the search space to a manageable size. It also
creates extremely smooth motions that follow a specified trajectory very accurately (in both position and
orientation), despite the discrete nature of binary actuation.

Abstract. This paper presents an overview of a parallelizing compiler
to automatically generate efficient code for large-scale parallel architectures from sequential input programs. This research focuses on loop-level
parallelism in dense matrix computations. We illustrate the basic techniques the compiler uses by describing the entire compilation process for
a simple example.
Our compiler is organized into three major phases: analyzing array references, allocating the computation and data to the processors to optimize
parallelism and locality, and generating code.
An optimizing compiler for scalable parallel machines requires more sophisticated program analysis than the traditional data dependence analysis. Our compiler uses a precise data-flow analysis technique to identify
the producer of the value read by each instance of a read access. In order to allocate the computation and data to the processors, the compiler
first transforms the program to expose loop-level parallelism in the computation. It then finds a decomposition of the computation and data
such that parallelism is exploited and the communication overhead is
minimized. The compiler will trade off extra degrees of parallelism to
reduce or eliminate communication. Finally, the compiler generates code
to manage the multiple address spaces and to communicate data across
processors.

//abstract
Abstract
CC ++ is Compositional C ++ , a parallel object-oriented notation
that consists of C ++ with six extensions. The goals of the CC ++
project are to provide a theory, notation and tools for developing reliable scalable concurrent program libraries, and to provide a framework
for unifying:
1. distributed reactive systems, batch-oriented numeric and sym
bolic applications, and user-interface systems,
2. declarative programs and object-oriented imperative programs,
and
3. deterministic and nondeterministic programs.
This paper is a brief description of the motivation for CC ++ , the
extensions to C ++ , a few examples of CC ++ programs with reasoning
about their correctness, and an evaluation of CC ++ in the context of
other research on concurrent computation. A short description of
C ++ is provided.

Abstract
The communication latency is a major issue that must be dealt with in parallel
computing. The parallel computation model therefore must provide the ability to tolerate
such latencies. Communication using blocking receives is the commonly used mechanism
in parallel programming today. Message driven execution is an alternate mechanism
which does not use receive style statements at all. The message driven execution style
promotes the overlap of computation and communication: Programs written in this style
exhibit increased latency tolerance. However, they are often difficult to develop and
debug. We present a coordination language called Dagger to alleviate this problem. The
language has a mechanism which is called expect, that replaces the receive statement.
It has been implemented in the Charm parallel programming system, and runs programs
portably on a variety of parallel machines.

Abstract
The advent and acceptance of massively parallel
machines has made it increasingly important to have
tools to analyze the performance of programs running on these machines. Current day performance
tools suffer from two drawbacks: they are not scalable
and they lose specific information about the user program in their attempt for generality. In this paper,
we present Projections, a scalable performance tool,
for Charm that can provide program-specific information to help the users better understand the behavior
of their programs.

Abstract One of the main hurdles to improved CLIR effectiveness is resolving ambiguity associated with translation.
Availability of resources is also a problem. First we present a
technique based on co-occurrence statistics from unlinked corpora which can be used to reduce the ambiguity associated with
phrasal and term translation. We then combine this method
with other techniques for reducing ambiguity and achieve more
than 90% monolingual effectiveness. Finally, we compare the
co-occurrence method with parallel corpus and machine translation techniques and show that good retrieval effectiveness can
be achieved without complex resources.

Abstract
The retrieval of images based on their visual similarity
to an example image is an important and fascinating area of
research. Here, a method to characterize visual appearance
for determining global similarity in images is described.
Images are filtered with Gaussian derivatives and geometric features are computed from the filtered images.
The geometric features used here are curvature and phase.
Two images may be said to be similar if they have similar distributions of such features. Global similarity may,
therefore, be deduced by comparing histograms of these
features. This allows for rapid retrieval and examples from
collection of gray-level and trademark images are shown.

Kinetic Binary Space Partitions for

Abstract
We describe randomized algorithms for efficiently maintaining a binary space partition of continuously moving, possibly
intersecting, line segments in the plane, and of continuously
moving but disjoint triangles in space. Our two-dimensional
BSP has depth O(log n) and size O(n log n + k) and can be
constructed in expected O(n log 2 n + k log n) time, where k
is the number of intersecting pairs. We can detect combinatorial changes to our BSP caused by the motion of the segments, and we can update our BSP in expected O(log n) time
per change. Our three-dimensional BSP has depth O(log n),
size O(n log 2 n+k 0 ), construction time O(n log 3 n+k 0 log n),
and update time O(log 2 n) (all expected), where k 0 is the
number of intersections between pairs of edges in the xy-projection of the triangles. Under reasonable assumptions
about the motion of the segments or triangles, the expected
number of number of combinatorial changes to either BSP is
O(mn s (n)), where m is the number of moving objects and
s (n) is the maximum length of an (n; s) Davenport-Schinzel
sequence for some constant s.

Abstract
The straight skeleton of a polygon is a variant of the medial axis, introduced by
Aichholzer et al., defined by a shrinking process in which each edge of the polygon
moves inward at a fixed rate. We construct the straight skeleton of an n-gon with r
reflex vertices in time O(n 1+" + n 8=11+" r 9=11+" ), for any fixed " &gt; 0, improving the
previous best upper bound of O(nr log n). Our algorithm simulates the sequence of
collisions between edges and vertices during the shrinking process, using a technique of
Eppstein for maintaining extrema of binary functions to reduce the problem of finding
successive interactions to two dynamic range query problems: (1) maintain a changing
set of triangles in IR 3 and answer queries asking which triangle would be first hit by
a query ray, and (2) maintain a changing set of rays in IR 3 and answer queries asking
for the lowest intersection of any ray with a query triangle. We also exploit a novel
characterization of the straight skeleton as a lower envelope of triangles in IR 3 . The same
time bounds apply to constructing non-self-intersecting offset curves with mitered or
beveled corners, and similar methods extend to other problems of simulating collisions
and other pairwise interactions among sets of moving objects.

Abstract
Since uncalibrated images permit only projective reconstruction, metric information requires either
camera or scene calibration. We propose a stratified approach to projective reconstruction, in which
gradual increase in domain information for scene calibration leads to gradual increase in 3D information.
Our scheme includes the following steps: (1) Register the images with respect to a reference plane; this
can be done using limited scene information, e.g., the knowledge that two pairs of lines on the plane are
parallel. We show that this calibration is sufficient for ordinal reconstruction sorting the points by their
height over the reference plane. (2) If available, use the relative height of two additional out-of-plane
points to compute the height of the remaining points up to constant scaling. Our scheme is based on the
dual epipolar geometry in the reference frame, which we develop below. We show good results with five
sequences of real images, using mostly scene calibration that can be inferred directly from the images
themselves.

Abstract: Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems
differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy
used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently
construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general,
we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively
constructs a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization,
which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we
evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control
strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering
in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization
strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by
analysts often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these
criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error
rate over completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this
performance task we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning
systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and
simplicity dimensions.

Abstract
We consider the problem of indexing general database
workloads (combinations of data sets and sets of potential queries). We define a framework for measuring the
efficiency of an indexing scheme for a workload based on
two characterizations: storage redundancy (how many
times each item in the data set is stored), and access
overhead (how many times more blocks than necessary
does a query retrieve). Using this framework we present
some initial results, showing upper and lower bounds
and trade-offs between them in the case of multi-dimensional range queries and set queries.

//abstract
The World-Wide Web is changing the nature of software development to a distributive
plug & play process. This requires a new way of managing software by so-called intelligent
software brokers. The aim of the European IBROW3 project is to develop an intelligent
brokering service that enables third party knowledge-component reuse through the
World-Wide Web. Suppliers provide libraries of knowledge components adhering to some
standard, and customers can consult these libraries -- through intelligent brokers -- to
configure a knowledge system suited to their needs by selection and adaptation. IBROW3
integrates research on heterogeneous databases, interoperability and web technology with
knowledge-system technology and ontologies. The aim is to develop a broker that can handle
web requests for classes of knowledge system (e.g. diagnostic systems) by accessing
libraries of reusable problem-solving methods on the Web, and selecting, adapting and
configuring these methods in accordance with the domain at hand.
The aim of this paper is to give a general overview of the project and to presents its main
ideas and approach. IBROW3 has started on January 1, 1998 and thus we can only present
preliminary results.

Abstract
A diagonal of a planar, simple polygon P is an open line segment that connects
two non-adjacent vertices and lies in the relative interior of P . We present a linear
time algorithm for finding a shortest diagonal (in the L 2 norm) of a simple polygon,
improving the previous best result by a factor of log n. Our result provides an interesting
contrast to a known (n log n) lower bound for finding a closest pair of vertices in a
simple polygon|observe that a shortest diagonal is defined by a closest pair of vertices
satisfying an additional visibility constraint.

Abstract
We present a randomized linear-time algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in a connected
graph with edge weights. The algorithm is a modification of one proposed by Karger and uses random
sampling in combination with a recently discovered linear-time algorithm for verifying a minimum spanning tree. Our computational model is a unit-cost random-access machine with the restriction that the
only operations allowed on edge weights are binary comparisons.

Markov Chain Algorithms for Planar Lattice Structures

Abstract
Consider the following Markov chain, whose states
are all domino tilings of a 2n fi 2n chessboard: starting from some arbitrary tiling, pick a 2 fi 2 window
uniformly at random. If the four squares appearing in
this window are covered by two parallel dominoes, rotate the dominoes in place. Repeat many times. This
process is used in practice to generate a random tiling,
and is a key tool in the study of the combinatorics of
tilings and the behavior of dimer systems in statistical physics. Analogous Markov chains are used to
randomly generate other structures on various two-dimensional lattices. This paper presents techniques
which prove for the first time that, in many interesting cases, a small number of random moves suffice to
obtain a uniform distribution.

Abstract
We empirically analyze and compare two simple, deterministic policies for scheduling dynamically evolving tree-structured computations on parallel architectures that are rings of identical
processing elements (PEs). Our computations have each task either halt or spawn two independent children; they abstract, for instance, computations generated by multigrid methods. Our
simpler policy, called koso, has each PE keep one child of a spawning task and pass the other
to its clockwise neighbor in the ring; our more sophisticated policy, called koso ? , operates similarly, but allows child-passing only from a more heavily loaded PE to a more lightly loaded one.
Both policies execute waiting tasks in increasing order of their depths in the evolving task-tree.
Based on partial (mathematical) analyses of our policies' behaviors, we conjectured that both
yield good parallel speedup on large classes of the computations we study, but that policy
koso ? outperforms policy koso in many important situations. Not having been able to verify
these conjectures analytically, we study them in this paper via a suite of carefully designed and
analyzed experiments. Our experiments largely substantiate both of our conjectures. We find
that both policies give close to optimal parallel speedup on large classes of computations, and
that koso ? outperforms koso on these computations, except on very small processor rings.
We believe that our methodology of experimental design and analysis will prove useful in other
such studies.

Using Real-Valued Genetic Algorithms to Evolve Rule Sets for
Classification

//abstract
Abstract| In this paper, we use a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of classification rules with
real-valued attributes. We show how real-valued
attribute ranges can be encoded with real-valued
genes and present a new uniform method for representing don't cares in the rules. We view supervised classification as an optimization problem,
and evolve rule sets that maximize the number of
correct classifications of input instances. We use a
variant of the Pitt approach to genetic-based machine learning system with a novel conflict resolution mechanism between competing rules within
the same rule set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach
on a benchmark wine classifier system.

Abstract
Today's high-performance RISC microprocessors have been
highly tuned for integer and floating point application performance. These architectures have paid less attention to
operating system requirements. At the same time, new operating system designs often have overlooked modern architectural trends which may unavoidably change the relative
cost of certain primitive operations. The result is that operating system performance is well below application code
performance on contemporary RISCs.
This paper examines recent directions in computer architecture and operating systems, and the implications of
changes in each domain for the other. The requirements of
three components of operating system design are discussed
in detail: interprocess communication, virtual memory, and
thread management. For each component, we relate operating system functional and performance needs to the mechanisms available on commercial RISC architectures such as
the MIPS R2000 and R3000, Sun SPARC, IBM RS6000,
Motorola 88000, and Intel i860.
Our analysis reveals a number of specific reasons why
the performance of operating system primitives on RISCs
has not scaled with integer performance. In addition,
we identify areas in which architectures could better (and
cost-effectively) accommodate operating system needs, and
areas in which operating system design could accommodate certain necessary characteristics of cost-effective high-performance microprocessors.

ABSTRACT
Many important and useful applications for software agents
require multiple agents on a network that communicate with
each other. Such agents must find each other and perform a
useful joint computation without having to know about every
other such agent on the network. This paper describes a
matchmaker
system, designed to find people with similar interests and introduce them to each other. The matchmaker is
designed to introduce
everyone
, unlike conventional Internet
media which only allow those who take the time to
speak
public to be known.
The paper details how the agents that make it up the match-making system can function in a decentralized fashion, yet
can group themselves into clusters which reflect their users
interests; these clusters are then used to make introductions or
allow users to send messages to others who share their inter
ests. The algorithm uses
referrals
from one agent to another
in the same fashion that word-of-mouth is used when people
are looking for an expert. A prototype of the system has been
implemented, and results of its use are presented.

Abstract
We describe the design and implementation of a compiler
that automatically translates ordinary programs written in
a subset of ML into code that generates native code at run
time. Run-time code generation can make use of values and
invariants that cannot be exploited at compile time, yielding
code that is often superior to statically optimal code. But
the cost of optimizing and generating code at run time can
be prohibitive. We demonstrate how compile-time specialization can reduce the cost of run-time code generation by
an order of magnitude without greatly affecting code quality.
Several benchmark programs are examined, which exhibit an
average cost of only six cycles per instruction generated at
run time.

Abstract
This paper provides a tutorial introduction to visual servo control of robotic manipulators.
Since the topic spans many disciplines our goal is limited to providing a basic conceptual framework. We begin by reviewing the prerequisite topics from robotics and computer vision, including
a brief review of coordinate transformations, velocity representation, and a description of the
geometric aspects of the image formation process. We then present a taxonomy of visual servo
control systems. The two major classes of systems, position-based and image-based systems, are
then discussed. Since any visual servo system must be capable of tracking image features in a
sequence of images, we include an overview of feature-based and correlation-based methods for
tracking. We conclude the tutorial with a number of observations on the current directions of
the research field of visual servo control.

Abstract
We have implemented a parallel version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm for the single-source shortest paths
problem. Our software has been developed on the CM-5 using C with CMMD communication primitives.
We have empirically compared the efficiency of our implementation with a sequential implementation of
the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm developed by Cherkassky, Goldberg and Radzik. We have performed
our experiments using fifty randomly generated graphs with vertex counts in the range between 2 10 and
2 15 and edge counts in the range between 2 11 and 2 21 . In our experiments, the parallel implementation
becomes faster than the sequential implementation when the average degree of the input graphs exceeds
2 5 or 2 6 . For the dense graphs in our test suite, we obtain speedups of up to 3.3 on 32 processors and up
to 8.3 on 128 processors.
In the implementation we discuss in this paper, several design decisions were taken in view of the limited
time we had to complete a working version of our software. For example, instead of performing any kind
of dynamic load balancing, we try to keep the computation load balanced by applying a straightforward
data distribution scheme at the beginning of the computation. Moreover, in the code that runs on
each processor, we avoid any sophisticated data structures and only use linear arrays. We are currently
experimenting with alternative implementations that may lead to improved speedups, particularly on the
denser graphs of our test suite.

We are developing design principles applying tangible interfaces to storytelling. This paper describes an underlying
philosophy and three resultant designs for computer-mediated toys, exploring how the merging of physical objects
with computer technology can enhance childrens storytelling. Each prototype aims to develop a specific set of both
oral and written storytelling skills, as well as collaboration, sharing, and the notion of revision. By creating
narratives, children learn about culture and identity, and develop a sense of self. In addition, narrative can be used as
a gateway to draw girls into technology. The use of multi-sensory interfaces allows for richer interaction.

Abstract
Despite the emergence of high speed LANs, the communication performance available to applications on workstation clusters still falls short of that available on MPPs.
A new generation of efficient messaging layers is needed to take advantage of the hardware performance and to deliver it to the application level. Communication software
is the key element in bridging the communication performance gap separating MPPs
and workstation clusters.
MPI-FM is a high performance implementation of MPI for networks of workstations connected with a Myrinet network, built on top of the Fast Messages (FM) library.
Based on the FM version 1.1 released in Fall 1995, MPI-FM achieves a minimum one-way latency of 19 s and a peak bandwidth of 17.3 MByte/s with common MPI send
and receive function calls. A direct comparison using published performance figures
shows that MPI-FM running on SPARCstation 20 workstations connected with a relatively inexpensive Myrinet network outperforms the MPI implementations available
on the IBM SP2 and the Cray T3D, both in latency and in bandwidth, for messages
up to 2 KByte in size.

Abstract
Multiple lightweight processes or threads have multiple stacks, and a thread context switch moves
execution from one stack to another. On the SPARC 1 architecture, parts of a thread's stack can be
cached in register windows while the thread is running. The cached data must be flushed to memory
when the thread is suspended. Doing the flushing both efficiently and correctly can be tricky. This
document discusses the implementation of a non-preemptive user-space threads package under SunOS 2 .

Abstract
A recognition strategy consisting of a mixture of indexing on invariants and search, allows objects to be recog-nised up to a Euclidean ambiguity with an uncalibrated
camera. The approach works by using projective invariants to determine all the possible projectively equivalent
models for a particular imaged object; then a system of
global consistency constraints is used to determine which of
these projectively equivalent, but Euclidean distinct, models corresponds to the objects viewed. These constraints
follow from properties of the imaging geometry. In particular, a recognition hypothesis is equivalent to an assertion about, among other things, viewing conditions and geometric relationships between objects, and these assertions
must be consistent for hypotheses to be correct. The approach is demonstrated to work on images of real scenes
consisting of polygonal objects and polyhedra.

Abstract
This paper describes several key trends in technology that will inuence the design of file systems for the next decade. It first outlines the basic trends to hardware performance that underlie
file system design. These trends affect both user demands on file systems and trade-offs in their
design. It then considers how technologies will drive more demanding file system workloads that
will require scalable file systems. Next, it outlines how opportunities raised by these low-level
technology trends impact specific aspects of the xFS file systems serverless design [Dahlin
et al., 1994b, Anderson et al., 1996]. Finally, to put xFSs serverless approach in context, it discusses other technology trends that affect file systems but that are not explicitly addressed in the
serverless design.

Importing Pre-packaged Software into Lisp: Experience with

//abstract
Abstract
We advocate the use of Common Lisp as a powerful glue for
building scientific computing environments. Naturally one
then has to address mixing pre-existing (non Lisp) code into
this system. We provide a specific example as an elaborate
FORTRAN system written by David Bailey for arbitrary-precision floating-point numeric calculation. We discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of wholesale importing into
Lisp. A major advantage is being able to use state-of-the
art packaged software sooner, while overcoming the disadvantages caused by FORTRAN's traditional batch orientation and weak storage model. In this paper we emphasize in
particular how effective use of imported systems may require
one to address the contrast between the functional (Lisp-like) versus state-transition-based (Fortran-like) approaches
to dealing with compound objects. While our example is
high-precision floats, other highly useful packages including those for simulation, PDE solutions, signal processing,
statistical computation, etc. may also benefit by similar
consideration.

Abstract
TCP is a reliable transport protocol tuned to perform well
in traditional networks made up of wired links with stationary hosts. Networks with wireless links and mobile
hosts violate many of the assumptions made by TCP, causing degraded performance. In this paper, we describe a
simple protocol that improves TCP performance by modifying network-layer software only at a basestation without
violating end-to-end TCP semantics. The main idea is to
cache packets at the basestation and perform local
retransmissions. Simulations of this protocol show that it
is significantly more robust in the presence of multiple
packet losses in a single transmission window as compared to TCP. This enables our protocol to tolerate at least
10 times as high an error rate without any performance
degradation.

Abstract
Several researchers have proposed algorithms for basic block reordering. We call these branch alignment algorithms. The primary
emphasis of these algorithms has been on improving instruction
cache locality, and the few studies concerned with branch prediction reported small or minimal improvements. As wide-issue architectures become increasingly popular the importance of reducing
branch costs will increase, and branch alignment is one mechanism
which can effectively reduce these costs.
In this paper, we propose an improved branch alignment algorithm that takes into consideration the architectural cost model and
the branch prediction architecture when performing the basic block
reordering. We show that branch alignment algorithms can improve
a broad range of static and dynamic branch prediction architectures.
We also show that a programs performance can be improved by approximately 5% even when using recently proposed, highly accurate
branch prediction architectures. The programs are compiled by any
existing compiler and then transformed via binary transformations.
When implementing these algorithms on a Alpha AXP 21604 up to
a 16% reduction in total execution time is achieved.

Abstract: This paper presents empirical data on the behavior of large dataflow programs on
a distributed memory multiprocessor. The programs, written in the dataflow language Id90, are
compiled via a Threaded Abstract Machine (TAM) for the CM-5. TAM refines dataflow execution
models by addressing critical constraints that modern parallel architectures place on the compilation
of general-purpose parallel programming languages. It exposes synchronization, scheduling, and
network access so that the compiler can optimize against the cost of these operations.
The data presented in this paper evaluates the TAM approach in compiling dataflow languages
on stock hardware. We present data on the instruction mix, speedup, scheduling behavior, and
locality of large ID90 programs. It is shown that the TAM scheduling hierarchy is able to tolerate
long communication latencies, especially when some degree of I-structure locality is present. We investigate how frame allocation strategies, k-bounded loops, and I-structure caching and distribution
together affect the overall efficiency. Finally we document some scheduling anomalies.

Abstract
As the difference in speed between processor and memory system continues to increase, it is becoming crucial to develop
and refine techniques that enhance the effectiveness of cache
hierarchies. Two such techniques are data prefetching and
data forwarding. With prefetching, a processor hides the latency of cache misses by requesting the data before it actually
needs it. With forwarding, a producer processor hides the
latency of communication-induced cache misses in the consumer processors by sending the data to the caches of the
latter. These two techniques are complementary approaches
to hiding the latency of communication-induced misses.
This paper compares the effectiveness of data forwarding
and data prefetching to hide communication-induced misses.
Although both techniques require comparable hardware support, forwarding usually has a lower instruction overhead. We
evaluate prefetching and forwarding algorithms in a paralleliz-ing compiler using execution-driven simulations of a shared-memory multiprocessor. Both data forwarding and prefetch-ing reduce the execution time of applications significantly (30-40% on average). Forwarding performs better on average,
while prefetching is more robust to changes in cache and memory parameters. Finally, we propose two ways of integrating
the two techniques. The integration of the two techniques reduces the execution time even more (43-48% on average) and
is very robust.

Optimizing Primary Data Caches for Parallel
Scientific Applications: The Pool Buffer Approach 1

Abstract
Optimizing on-chip primary data caches for parallel scientific applications is challenging because different applications
exhibit different behavior. Indeed, while some applications
exhibit good spatial locality, others have accesses with long
strides that prevent the effective use of cache lines. Finally,
other applications cannot exploit long lines because they exhibit false sharing. To help processors execute these three
types of applications efficiently, we introduce the Pool Buffer,
a small direct-mapped cache accessed in parallel with the primary cache. The function of the pool buffer is to fetch long
sectors of relatively short cache lines from memory on a miss,
while only letting into the cache the lines that the processor
actually references. The pool buffer can also perform sequential prefetching of sectors.
An evaluation of the pool buffer based on simulations of
five 32-processor Perfect Club codes yields encouraging results. Adding a pool buffer of one-quarter the size of the
cache causes a small increase in area while usually achieving
large reductions in execution time. For example, for a range
of caches with 32-byte lines, the execution time decreases by
an average of about 20%. We also show that small 1-Kbyte
buffers are often large enough to get most of the potential
benefits. Finally, caches with pool buffers are more effective
than caches with long lines and no pool buffer.

Abstract
In image segmentation problems, there is usually a vast amount of filter
operations available, a subset of which has to be selected and instantiated
in order to obtain a satisfactory segmentation procedure for a particular domain. In supervised segmentation, a mapping from features, such as filter
outputs for individual pixels, to classes is induced automatically. However,
since the sample size required for supervised learning grows exponentially
in the number of features it is not feasible to learn a segmentation procedure
from a large amount of possible filters. But we argue that automatic model
selection methods are able to select a region model in terms of some filters.
We propose a wrapper algorithm that performs this task. We present results
on artificial textured images (Brodatz) and report on our experiences with
x-ray images.

Abstract. In this work it will be shown, how the comparison of recursive program schemata (RPS) can be reduced to an only slightly modified
type of the search for maximal isomorphic subgraphs by interpreting the
RPS as directed, cyclic, labelled graphs. The quality of the mapping of
two RPS can be used as a quantitative measure for similarity of RPS
among each other. The simultaneously calculated graph morphism can
serve as a basis for the detection of analogies between the RPS. A special
neural net, developed for the solution of general graph-matching problems, realizes the search for a sensible and as comprising as possible
mapping between two RPS. It is shown, which special properties of RPS
have to be accounted for in the modeling and how these can be incorporated into the algorithms when using a special neural approach for the
solution.

Abstract
Kinetic simulation of plasmas in which equilibrium occurs over ion timescales poses
a computational challenge due to the disparate timescales of the electron plasma frequency (~ 10 9 ), the ion plasma frequency (~ 10 7 ), ion transit frequency (~ 10 6 ), and
the ionization frequency (~ 10 7 ). Hybrid electrostatic PIC algorithms are presented
in which the electrons reach thermodynamic equilibrium with the ions each time step.
There are two different approximations for the electrons. First, the nonlinear Boltzmann relationship for the electrons can be applied to the bulk of a plasma. Second,
there is a truncated Maxwellian which is used in sheaths; this approximation truncates
the electron distribution at the wall potential. The error associated with neglecting
this second approximation in the sheath is small. The collision cross section, (E), can
be a tabulated or fitted function; the method is implemented with He cross sections.
These approximations neglect effects faster than ion time-scales, decreasing the computer time used by over an order of magnitude; however, they increase the complexity
of the boundary conditions and the simulation is no longer self-consistent. Theoretical
ramifications of these approximations are examined, and results are compared with full

Abstract
Experiments have shown[1],[2] that ion acoustic solitons tunnel through the space charge sheath
in front of a grid without time delay. They are absorbed resonantly when the spatial width of the
wave is close to the characteristic gradient scale length of the sheath. The reflection and transmission
coefficients found in these experiments have compared well with theory in the long wavelength limit[3].
However, to achieve this comparison, two parameters were added that were not in the original theory.
These parameters allow for the absorption of wave energy by the space charge sheath. The goal of our
numerical simulations, designed to reproduce the experimental results, is to uncover the mechanism of
this energy loss and large speed of propagation through the sheath.

Abstract
This survey paper describes the current approaches on the update-in-place analysis
for sets. Pure functional languages do not allow mutations, destructive updates, or selective updates so that straightforward implementations of functional language compilers
may induce large amounts of copying to preserve program semantics. The unnecessary
copying of data can increase both the execution time and the memory requirements of
an application. Introducing sets to functional languages as a primitive data constructor posts a new problem of update-in-place analysis in functional languages. Moreover, most of the compiler optimization techniques depend on the side-effects and the
update-in-place analysis serves as the premise of applying such optimization techniques.
Among other compiler optimization techniques, finite differencing captures common yet
distinctive program constructions of costly repeated calculations and transforms them
into more efficient incremental program constructions. This dissertation is an attempt
to explore the update-in-place analysis for sets in functional languages in order to apply finite differencing to compiling pure functional languages. In this survey paper,
we will describe the approaches of update-in-place analysis and the finite differencing
techniques.

Search for Chargino and Neutralino
Production Using the OPAL Detector
at
s = 130 136 GeV at LEP
The OPAL Collaboration
//abstract
Abstract
A search for charginos and neutralinos, predicted by supersymmetric theories, has been
performed using a data sample of 2.6 pb 1 at a centre-of-mass energy of p s =130 GeV and
2.6 pb 1 at 136 GeV collected with the OPAL detector at LEP during November 1995. No
candidate events were observed. The 95% C.L. lower limit on the lightest chargino mass
in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is 65.4 GeV if the universal scalar mass
m 0 is greater than 1 TeV, and 58.7 GeV for the smallest m 0 compatible with slepton and
sneutrino mass limits obtained at centre-of-mass energies near the Z peak. These limits
were obtained under the conditions that the lightest chargino is heavier than the lightest
neutralino by more than 10 GeV and tan fi is larger than 1.5. The results of a model
independent search for charginos and neutralinos are also given.

Abstract
We argue that the specification of an object's functional behavior and the timing constraints imposed
on it may be separated. Specifically, we describe
RTsynchronizer, a high-level programming language
construct for specifying real-time constraints between
objects in a distributed concurrent system. During program execution, RTsynchronizers affect the
scheduling of distributed objects to enforce real-time
relations between events. Objects in our system are
defined in terms of the actor model extended with
timing assumptions. Separation of the functional
behaviors of actors and the timing constraints on
patterns of actor invocation provides at least three
important advantages. First, it simplifies code development by separating design concerns. Second,
multiple timing constraints can be independently
specified and composed. And finally, a specification
of timing constraints can be reused even if the
representation of the functional behavior of actors has
changed, and conversely.
A number of examples are given to illustrate the
use of RTsynchronizers. These examples illustrate
how real-time constraints for periodic events, simultaneous events, exception handling, and producer-consumer may be specified.

Abstract
Concurrent systems maintain a distributed state and thus require coordination and synchronization between
components to ensure consistency. To provide a coherent design approach to concurrent systems, recent work
has employed an object-based methodology which emphasizes interactions through well-defined interfaces. The
Actor model has provided formal reasoning about distributed object systems. Nonetheless, due to the complex
interactions among components and the high volume of observable information produced, understanding and
reasoning about concurrent algorithms in terms of simple interactions is a difficult task. Coordination patterns,
which abstract over simple interactions, are not biased by low-level event orderings and are the appropriate
mechanism for reasoning about concurrent algorithms. We outline a methodology for visualizing coordination
patterns in concurrent algorithms which emphasizes observable interactions and causal connections between
objects. We introduce visualizers as a linguistic mechanism for mapping coordination patterns to visualization.
Visualizers are specified separately from algorithm code and thus respect code integrity. Moreover, visualizers
may be implemented strictly in terms of object interfaces and thus preserve object encapsulation.

Billing Users and Pricing for TCP
//author
Richard J. Edell , Nick McKeown and Pravin P. Varaiya
//abstract
Abstract| This paper presents a system for billing users
for their TCP traffic. This is achieved by postponing the
establishment of connections while the user is contacted,
verifying in a secure way that they are prepared to pay. By
presenting the user with cost and price information, the system can be used for cost recovery and to encourage efficient
use of network resources. The system requires no changes to
existing protocols or applications and can be used to recover
costs between cooperating sites. Statistics collected from a
four day trace of traffic between the University of Califor-nia, Berkeley and the rest of the Internet demonstrate that
such a billing system is practical and introduces acceptable
latency. An implementation based on the BayBridge prototype router is described. Our study also indicates that
pricing schemes may be used to control network congestion
either by rescheduling time-insensitive traffic to a less expensive time of the day, or by smoothing packet transfers to
reduce traffic peaks.

Abstract
Learning to predict rare events from sequences of events
with categorical features is an important, real-world,
problem that existing statistical and machine learning
methods are not well suited to solve. This paper describes
timeweaver, a genetic algorithm based machine learning
system that predicts rare events by identifying predictive
temporal and sequential patterns. Timeweaver is applied to
the task of predicting telecommunication equipment failures
from 110,000 alarm messages and is shown to outperform
existing learning methods.

Abstract
Rules extracted from trained feedforward networks
can be used for explanation, validation, and cross-referencing of network output decisions. This paper
introduces a rule evaluation and ordering mechanism
that orders rules extracted from feedforward networks
based on three performance measures. Detailed experiments using three rule extraction techniques as applied
to the Wisconsin breast cancer database, illustrate the
power of the proposed methods. Moreover, a method
of integrating the output decisions of both the extracted
rule-based system and the corresponding trained network is proposed. The integrated system provides further improvements.

Abstract
Asymptotic tracking is studied for systems in which the relative degree is not well defined,
meaning that the control law derived from exact input-output linearization has singularities in
the state space. We propose a tracking control law which switches between approximate tracking
[1] close to the singularities, and exact tracking away from the singularities, and we study the
applicability of this law based on the behavior of the system's zero dynamics at the switching
boundary. As in [1], the ball and beam example is used to motivate the study.

for verification of hybrid control system, a simulation

Abstract
Using linguistic variables to describe the behavior of a
hybrid system, which consists of a discrete event system and a continuous system, could make the design
of the controller and verification of the system perform
on an unified framework. In this paper, we show the
construction of a fuzzy linguistic model from a given
mathematical model of a physical system. By considering the state-space realization of the model, the system
construction problem can be transformed into a function approximation problem. We propose to use projection theorem in obtaining an optimal fuzzy system
which is the best approximation of a given nonlinear
function in L 2 (U ) space. We show that the existence
and uniqueness of the optimal solution is assured when
the Fuzzy Basis Functions(FBFs) are linearly independent. We demonstrate that the dependence of the basis
functions can be examined by checking the condition of
the Gram determinant associated to the FBFs. Finally,
a method is proposed in converting the optimal coefficients into fuzzy sets to obtain a fuzzy linguistic model.

ABSTRACT
In a new collaborative project involving the University of California, Berkeley, NASA Ames Research
Center, and Honeywell Systems Research Center, we
have begun the study of hierarchical, hybrid control
systems in the framework of air traffic management
systems (ATMS). The need for a new ATMS arises
from the overcrowding of large urban airports and
the need to more efficiently land and take off larger
numbers of aircraft, without building new runways.
Technological advances that make a more advanced
air traffic control system a reality include the availability of relatively inexpensive and fast real time
computers (both on board the aircraft and in the control tower) and global positioning systems. The usefulness of these technological advances is currently
limited by today's air traffic control system, which
involves the use of "freeways" in the Terminal Radar
Approach Control (TRACON) region around urban
airports. These freeways are set approach patterns
to runways which do not allow for the possibility of
so-called "free flight" by an aircraft to its destination.
Limiting the aircraft trajectories in this manner results in the addition of both planned and unplanned
delays to air travel.

Abstract
We propose a hierarchical control architecture for dealing with faults and adverse environmental conditions on an Automated Highway System (AHS). Our design extends
a previous control architecture that works under normal conditions of operation. The
faults that are considered in our design are classified according to the capabilities remaining on the vehicle or roadside after the fault has occurred. Information about these
capabilities is used by supervisors in each of the layers of the architecture to select appropriate control strategies. We outline the extended control strategies that are needed
by these supervisors and, in certain cases, give examples of their detailed operation.

Abstract
The aim of this paper is to explore intrinsic geometric methods of recovering the three
dimensional motion of a moving camera from a sequence of images. Generic similarities between
the discrete approach and the differential approach are revealed through a parallel development
of their analogous motion estimation theories.
We begin with a brief review of the (discrete) essential matrix approach, showing how to
recover the 3D displacement from image correspondences. The space of normalized essential
matrices is characterized geometrically: the unit tangent bundle of the rotation group is a
double covering of the space of normalized essential matrices. This characterization naturally
explains the geometry of the possible number of 3D displacements which can be obtained from
the essential matrix.
Second, a differential version of the essential matrix constraint previously explored by [19, 20]
is introduced. We then present the precise characterization of the space of differential essential
matrices, which gives rise to a novel eigenvector-decomposition-based 3D velocity estimation
algorithm from the optical flow measurements. This algorithm gives a unique solution to the
motion estimation problem and serves as a differential counterpart of the SVD-based 3D displacement estimation algorithm from the discrete case.
Finally, simulation results are presented evaluating the performance of our algorithm in terms
of bias and sensitivity of the estimates with respect to the noise in optical flow measurements.
The presented unifying theory of the motion estimation using discrete and differential version of the Longuet-Higgins (essential) constraint can be extended to the case of uncalibrated
cameras.

ABSTRACT
Air Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) of the future will feature Free Flight, in which aircraft choose
their own routes, altitude, and speed, and automated conflict resolution methods in which aircraft
will coordinate to resolve conflicts. The resulting distributed control architecture is a hybrid system, with
mixed discrete event and continuous time dynamics.
SmartATMS is an object oriented modeling and simulation facility which accounts for these hybrid issues
and will serve as a uniform modeling framework for
the design and evaluation of various ATMS concepts.

Abstract
We present a user interface paradigm for
database management systems that is motivated
by scientific visualization applications. Our
graphical user interface includes a "boxes and arrows" notation for database access and a flight
simulator model of movement through information space. We also provide means to specify a
hierarchy of abstracts of data of different types
and resolutions, so that a "zoom" capability can
be supported. The underlying DBMS support for
this system is described and includes the compilation of query plans into megaplans, new algorithms for data buffering, and provisions for
a guaranteed rate of data delivery. The current state of the Tioga implementation is also described.

ABSTRACT
In this paper we present a prototype system for
the management of earth science data which is
novel in that it takes a DBMS centric view of the
the task. Our prototype -- called "BigSur" -- is
shown in the context of its use by two geographically distributed scientific groups with demanding data storage and processing requirements.
BigSur currently stores 1 Terabyte of data, about
one thousandth of the volume EOSDIS must
store. We claim that the design principles
embodied in BigSur provide sufficient exibility
to achieve the difficult scientific and technical
objectives of Mission to Planet Earth.

Abstract
The increasing size and complexity of many software
systems demand a greater emphasis on capturing and
maintaining knowledge at many different levels within
the software development process. This knowledge includes descriptions of the hardware and software components and their behavior, external and internal design specifications, and support for system testing.
The knowledge-based software engineering (KBSE) research paradigm is concerned with systems that use
formally represented knowledge, with associated inference procedures, to support the various subactivi-ties of software development. As they grow in scale,
KBSE systems must balance expressivity and inferential power with the real demands of knowledge base
construction, maintenance, performance and comprehensibility. Description Logics (DL's) possess several
features a terminological orientation, a formal semantics and efficient reasoning procedures which offer an effective tradeoff of these factors. We discuss
three KBSE systems in which DL's capture some of
the requisite knowledge needed to support design, coding and testing activities. We close with a discussion
of the benefits of DL's and ways to address some of
their limitations.

Abstract
People can differentiate spoken languages
without understanding them, and, in some
sense, this differentiation can only be done
without understanding the language. When
we consider a multi-lingual person trying to
understand an utterance spoken in one of the
languages with which they are familiar, they
will first decide which language this utterance
belongs to, before trying to interpret it.
The language identification task is one
example of high-level feature abstraction from
raw speech. Speech samples are classified
into categories according to what language
was spoken. We conjecture that this classification can be performed reliably and in real
time. To be successful, such a system should
be speaker-independent as well as context-independent. A large amount of training is
required to achieve a satisfactory level of performance.
We present a continuation of previous
work (Kwasny et al., 1992) which introduces
two important improvements to the system:
(1) replacement of the non-recurrent, feed-forward network with a recurrent one, which
is smaller, but still classifies correctly; (2)
development of a frontend processor on a
Nextfi workstation to facilitate sample
recording and data acquisition. This is important for large-scale data acquisition, training,
and testing of the network.

Abstract
We consider the problem of maximum a posteriori (MAP) restoration of multicolor images
where each pixel has been degraded by independent arbitrary noise. We assume that the
prior distribution is given by a Markov random field with only pairwise site interactions.
Two classes of site interactions are considered: two-valued site interactions, which form a
generalized Potts model; and linear site interactions. We give efficient algorithms based on
graph cuts for both classes. The MAP estimate for a generalized Potts model can be computed by solving a multiway minimum cut problem on a graph. While this graph problem is
computationally intractable, there are fast algorithms for computing provably good approximations. The MAP estimate with linear site interactions can be computed exactly by solving
a minimum cut problem on a graph. This can be performed in nearly linear time.

Abstract: This paper presents several patterns for distributing business information systems that are structured according to a layered architecture. 2 Each distribution pattern cuts the architecture into different client and server components. All
the patterns presented give an answer to the same question: How do I distribute a
business information system? However, the consequences of applying the patterns
are very different with regards to the forces influencing distributed systems design.

Abstract
Query caching can play a vital role in heterogeneous, multi-database environments. Answers to a query that are available in cache
at the local client can be returned to the user
quickly, while the rest of the query is evaluated. The use of caches can optimize query
evaluation. By caching certain sensitive data
locally, caches can be used to answer the parts
of queries that involve the sensitive data, so it
need not be shipped across the network. Most
prior cache schemes have been tuple-based or
page-based. It is unclear, however, how these
might be adapted for multi-databases. We explore a more flexible semantic query caching
(SQC) approach. In SQC, caches are the answer sets of previous queries, labeled by the
query expressions that produced them. We
promote developing the technology, based on
logic, to manipulate semantic caches, to determine when and how caches can be used to answer subsequent queries, and to optimize via
cache use.

Abstract. This paper develops a new I/O automaton model called the
Clock General Timed Automaton (Clock GTA) model. The Clock GTA
is based on the General Timed Automaton (GTA) of Lynch and Vaan-
drager. The Clock GTA provides a systematic way of describing timing-
based systems in which there is a notion of "normal" timing behavior,
but that do not necessarily always exhibit this "normal" behavior. It can
be used for practical time performance analysis based on the stabilization
of the physical system.
We use the Clock GTA automaton to model, verify and analyze the
paxos algorithm. The paxos algorithm is an efficient and highly fault-
tolerant algorithm, devised by Lamport, for reaching consensus in a distributed system. Although it appears to be practical, it is not widely
known or understood. This paper contains a new presentation of the
paxos algorithm, based on a formal decomposition into several interacting components. It also contains a correctness proof and a time performance and fault-tolerance analysis.

Finding Maximum Flows in Undirected Graphs Seems Easier than
Bipartite Matching +L 
//author
David R. Karger and Matthew S. Levine
//abstract
Abstract
Consider an n-vertex, m-edge, undirected graph with maximum flow value v. We give a method to find augmenting
paths in such a graph in amortized sub-linear (O(n
p
v)) time
per path. This lets us improve the time bound of the classic augmenting path algorithm to O(m + nv 3=2 ) on simple
graphs. The addition of a blocking flow subroutine gives a
simple, deterministic O(nm 2=3 v 1=6 )-time algorithm. We also
use our technique to improve known randomized algorithms,
giving O(m+nv 5=4 )-time and O(m+n 11=9 v)-time algorithms
for capacitated undirected graphs. For simple graphs, in
which v n, the last bound is O(n 2:2 ), improving on the best
previous bound of O(n 2:5 ), which is also the best known time
bound for bipartite matching.

Bounds on the Time to Detect Failures
Using Bounded-capacity Message Links
//author
Stephen Ponzio
//affiliation
MIT Laboratory for Computer Science
//abstract
Abstract
We consider a system of distributed processors that
communicate by passing messages and that have inexact information about time. Specifically, a processor knows that a single message is delayed by at most
time d and the time between any two of its consecutive steps is at least c 1 and at most c 2 ; it has no
other way of estimating elapsed time. This simple
model is very close to traditional models used in distributed computing theory, and has been studied by
Attiya and Lynch [2, 1] among others. We extend
the model by making a realistic assumption about
how the delay of messages is affected by the rate at
which they are sent. We define a model of message
links with bounded capacity, which are guaranteed to
deliver messages at only a given rate. If a processor sends messages at a greater rate, they may incur
greater delay.
We quantify the effect of this bounded capacity on
the time necessary to detect processor failures. We
consider a system of two processors connected by a
bi-directional message link of (integral) capacity .
First we give two very simple protocols that guarantee any stopping failure will be detected within
time 2Cd + d and C 2 d= + Cd + d respectively,
where C = c 2 =c 1 . The main result is an almost-matching lower bound of 2Cd+d= or C 2 d=+Cd+d,
whichever is less. If the link is uni-directional, our result specializes to give a matching upper and lower
bound of C 2 d= + Cd + d.

The Design and Implementation of SOLAR,
a Portable Library for Scalable Out-of-Core Linear Algebra Computations
//author
Sivan Toledo Fred G. Gustavson

//abstract
Abstract
SOLAR is a portable high-performance library for out-of-core dense
matrix computations. It combines portability with high performance
by using existing high-performance in-core subroutine libraries and
by using an optimized matrix input-output library. SOLAR works on
parallel computers, workstations, and personal computers. It supports
in-core computations on both shared-memory and distributed-memory
machines, and its matrix input-output library supports both conventional I/O interfaces and parallel I/O interfaces. This paper discusses
the overall design of SOLAR, its interfaces, and the design of several
important subroutines. Experimental results show that SOLAR can
factor on a single workstation an out-of-core positive-definite symmetric matrix at a rate exceeding 215 Mflops, and an out-of-core general
matrix at a rate exceeding 195 Mflops. Less than 16% of the running
time is spent on I/O in these computations. These results indicate
that SOLAR's portability does not compromise its performance. We
expect that the combination of portability, modularity, and the use of
a high-level I/O interface will make the library an important platform
for research on out-of-core algorithms and on parallel I/O.

Abstract
We have implemented a prototype compiler called porch that transforms C programs into C programs supporting portable checkpoints. Portable checkpoints capture the state of a computation in
a machine-independent format that allows the transfer of computations across binary incompatible machines. We introduce source-to-source compilation techniques for generating code to save and
recover from such portable checkpoints automatically. These techniques instrument a program with code that maps the state of a computation into a machine-independent representation and vice versa.
In particular, the following problems are addressed: (1) providing
stack environment portability, (2) enabling conversion of complex
data types, and (3) rendering pointers portable. Experimental results show that the overhead of checkpointing is reasonably small,
even if data representation conversion is required for portability.

Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso

//abstract
Abstract
We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The "lasso"
minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute
value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature
of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero
and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that
the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection
and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection
and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting
relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho
and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a
variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models
and tree-based models are briefly described.

Abstract
A new method for extracting planar polygonal rooftops in monocular aerial imagery is proposed. Through bottom-up and top-down construction of perceptual groups, polygons in a
single aerial image can be robustly extracted.
Orthogonal corners and lines are extracted and
hierarchically related using perceptual grouping techniques. Top-down feature verification is
used so that features, and links between the features, are verified with local information in the
image and weighed in a graph structure according to the underlying support for each feature.
Cycles in the graph correspond to possible
building rooftop hypotheses. Virtual features
are hypothesized for the perceptual completion
of partial rooftops. Extraction of the "best"
grouping of features into a building rooftop hypothesis is posed as a graph search problem.
The maximally weighted, independent set of cycles in the graph is extracted as the final set of
roof boundaries.

model are calculated that correspond to the movement
of the fingertips in the image plane. Trajectories of
the moving models are then established to show the 3-D nature of hand motion.

Abstract
Multi-chip module (MCM) packaging techniques present several new technical challenges, notably substrate testing. We formulate MCM substrate testing as a problem of connectivity verification in trees via k-probes, and present a linear-time algorithm which computes a minimum
set of probes achieving complete open fault coverage. Since actual substrate testing also involves
scheduling probe operations, we formulate efficient probe scheduling as a special type of metric
traveling salesman optimization and give a provably-good heuristic. Empirical results using both
random and industry benchmarks demonstrate reductions in testing costs of up to 21% over previous methods. We conclude with generalizations to alternate probe technologies and several open
problems.

Abstract
With fast switching speeds and large interconnect trees (MCMs), the
resistance and inductance of interconnect has a dominant impact on
logic gate delay. In this paper, we propose a new P model for distributed RC and RLC interconnects to estimate the driving point admittance at the output of a CMOS gate. Using this model we are able to
compute the gate delay efficiently, within 25% of SPICE-computed delays. Our parameters depend only on total interconnect tree resistance
and capacitance at the output of the gate. Previous effective load capacitance methods [7, 9], applicable only for distributed RC interconnects, are based on P model parameters obtained via a recursive admittance moment computation. Our model should be useful for iterative
optimization of performance-driven routing or for estimation of gate
delay and rise times in high-level synthesis.

Abstract
With submicron technologies, gate delays are dominated by gate
load delays rather than intrinsic gate delays. While the common approach for computing gate load delay (or total gate delay) is through
delay tables (or k-factor equations), there are important methodology problems associated with the delay table approach. In this paper, we propose a gate driver model with a Thevenin equivalent circuit consisting of a ramp voltage source whose slew time is obtained
from the gate slew tables, and a driver resistance in series with the
gate load. We then develop analytical gate delay formulas using this
Thevenin driver model and modeling the load with various gate load
models under both rising and falling ramp input.

Abstract
Increasingly popular reuse-based design paradigms create a pressing need for authorship enforcement techniques that protect the intellectual property rights of designers. We develop the first intellectual property protection protocols for embedding design watermarks at the physical design level. We demonstrate that these protocols are transparent with respect to existing industrial tools and
design flows, and that they can embed watermarks into real-world
industrial designs with very low implementation overhead (as measured by such standard metrics as wirelength, layout area, number
of vias, routing congestion and CPU time). On several industrial
test cases, we obtain extremely strong, tamper-resistant proofs of
authorship for placement and routing solutions.

Abstract
This paper presents general algorithms for concurrency control in
tree-based access methods as well as a recovery protocol and a
mechanism for ensuring repeatable read. The algorithms are developed in the context of the Generalized Search Tree (GiST) data
structure, an index structure supporting an extensible set of queries
and data types. Although developed in a GiST context, the algorithms are generally applicable to many tree-based access methods.
The concurrency control protocol is based on an extension of the
link technique originally developed for B-trees, and completely
avoids holding node locks during I/Os. Repeatable read isolation is
achieved with a novel combination of predicate locks and two-phase
locking of data records. To our knowledge, this is the first time that
isolation issues have been addressed outside the context of B-trees.
A discussion of the fundamental structural differences between B-trees and more general tree structures like GiSTs explains why the
algorithms developed here deviate from their B-tree counterparts.
An implementation of GiSTs emulating B-trees in DB2/Common
Server is underway.

Abstract
The simulation preorder on state transition systems is widely accepted as a
useful notion of refinement, both in its own right and as an efficiently checkable sufficient condition for trace containment. For composite systems, due to
the exponential explosion of the state space, there is a need for decomposing a
simulation check of the form P s Q into simpler simulation checks on the components of P and Q. We present an assume-guarantee rule that enables such a
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first assume-guarantee
rule that applies to a refinement relation different from trace containment. Our
rule is circular, and its soundness proof requires induction on trace-trees. The
proof is constructive: given simulation relations that witness the simulation
preorder between components, we provide a procedure for constructing a witness relation for P s Q. We also extend our assume-guarantee rule to account
for fairness assumptions on transition systems.

Abstract
In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterization of the steady state throughput, as a function of loss rate and round trip time for a bulk transfer TCP flow, i.e., a flow with an unlimited amount
of data to send. Unlike the models in [6, 7, 10], our model captures not only the behavior of TCP's fast
retransmit mechanism (which is also considered in [6, 7, 10]) but also the effect of TCP's timeout mechanism on throughput. Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling
perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more timeout events than fast retransmit events.
Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP throughput and is
accurate over a wider range of loss rates.

Abstract
In the past few years there has been an increasing interest in workflow applications as a
way of supporting complex business processes in modern corporations. Given the nature
of the environment and the technology involved, workflow applications are inherently
distributed and pose many interesting challenges to the system designer. In most cases, a
client/server architecture is used in which knowledge about the processes being executed is
centralized in one node to facilitate monitoring, auditing, and to simplify synchronization.
In this paper, we explore a novel distributed architecture, Exotica/FMQM, for workflow
systems in which the need for such a centralized database is eliminated. Instead, we use
persistent messages as the means to store the information relevant to the execution of a
business process. Our approach is to completely distribute the execution of a process so
individual nodes are independent. The advantages of this approach are increased resilience
to failures and greater scalability and flexibility of the system configuration.

ABSTRACT
The problem of source
identification involves correctly
classifying an incoming signal into
a category that identifies the
signal's source.
The problem is difficult because
information is not provided
distinguishing characteristics and
because successive signals from the
same source differ. The source
identification problem can be made
more difficult by dynamically
changing the repertoire of sources
while the problem is being solved.
We used genetic programming to
evolve both the topology and the
sizing (numerical values) for each
component of an analog electrical
circuit that can correctly classify an
incoming analog electrical signal
into three categories. Then, the
repertoire of sources was
dynamically changed by adding a
new source during the run. The
paper describe show the
enabled genetic programming to
adapt, during the run, to the
changed environment. Specifically,
a three-way source identification
circuit was evolved and then
adapted into a four-way classifier,
during the run, thereby successfully
handling the additional new source.

Abstract
Network throughput can be increased by allowing mul-tipath, adaptive routing. Adaptive routing allows more
freedom in the paths taken by messages, spreading load
over physical channels more evenly. The flexibility of
adaptive routing introduces new possibilities of deadlock. Previous deadlock avoidance schemes in k-ary n-cubes require an exponential number of virtual channels
[17]. We describe a family of deadlock-free routing algorithms, called planar-adaptive routing algorithms which
require only a constant number of virtual channels, independent of network size and dimension. Planar-adaptive
routing algorithms reduce the complexity of deadlock
prevention by reducing the number of choices at each
routing step. In the fault-free case, planar-adaptive
networks are guaranteed to be deadlock-free. In the
presence of network faults, the planar-adaptive router
can be extended with misrouting to produce a working network which remains provably deadlock free and
is provably livelock free. In addition, planar adaptive
networks can simultaneously support both in-order and
adaptive, out-of-order packet delivery.
Planar-adaptive routing is of practical significance. It
provides the simplest known support for deadlock-free
adaptive routing in k-ary n-cubes of more than two
dimensions (with k &gt; 2). Restricting adaptivity reduces the hardware complexity, improving router speed
or allowing additional performance-enhancing network
features. The structure of planar-adaptive routers is
amenable to efficient implementation.

Abstract
Information retrieval differs significantly from function approximation in that the goal is for the system to achieve the same ranking
function of documents relative to queries as the user: the outputs of
the system relative to one another must be in the proper order. We
hypothesize that a particular rank-order statistic, Guttman's point
alienation, is the proper objective function for such a system, and
demonstrate its efficacy by using it to find the optimal combination
of retrieval experts. In application to a commercial retrieval system,
the combination performs 47% better than any single expert.

Abstract
Network bandwidth has always been a key issue for multimedia protocols. Many potential users of networked multimedia protocols will continue to have low bandwidth network
connections for some time: copper wire ISDN, infra-red, cellular modems, etc.. Compression provides potential relief for users of slow networks by increasing effective bandwidth.
HBX introduces a new technique, based on arithmetic coding and statistical modeling, for
compressing structured data. Applied to the X networked graphics protocol, this technique
yields 4.5:1 compression across a representative set of traces, performing twice as well as the
popular LZW-based Xremote compression protocol. HBX's coding techniques are generally
applicable to the graphics and imaging subset of multimedia protocols. Future work will
determine whether HBX's coding techniques can be applied to audio and video streams as
well.

Fast Volume Rendering Using a Shear-Warp Factorization
of the Viewing Transformation

//abstract
Abstract
Several existing volume rendering algorithms operate by factoring the viewing transformation into a 3D shear parallel to the data
slices, a projection to form an intermediate but distorted image,
and a 2D warp to form an undistorted final image. We extend
this class of algorithms in three ways. First, we describe a new
object-order rendering algorithm based on the factorization that is
significantly faster than published algorithms with minimal loss
of image quality. Shear-warp factorizations have the property that
rows of voxels in the volume are aligned with rows of pixels in the
intermediate image. We use this fact to construct a scanline-based
algorithm that traverses the volume and the intermediate image in
synchrony, taking advantage of the spatial coherence present in
both. We use spatial data structures based on run-length encoding
for both the volume and the intermediate image. Our implementation running on an SGI Indigo workstation renders a 256 3 voxel
medical data set in one second. Our second extension is a shear-warp factorization for perspective viewing transformations, and
we show how our rendering algorithm can support this extension.
Third, we introduce a data structure for encoding spatial coherence
in unclassified volumes (i.e. scalar fields with no precomputed
opacity). When combined with our shear-warp rendering algorithm this data structure allows us to classify and render a 256 3
voxel volume in three seconds. The method extends to support
mixed volumes and geometry and is parallelizable.

Abstract
This paper presents a progressive refinement algorithm for
volume rendering which uses a pyramidal volume representation. Besides storing average values, the pyramid stores
estimated error, so an oct-tree can be fit to the pyramid
given a user-supplied precision. This oct-tree is then drawn
using a set of splats, or footprints, each scaled to match the
size of the projection of a cell. The splats themselves are approximated with RGBA Gouraud-shaded polygons, so that
they can be drawn efficiently on modern graphics workstations. The result is a real-time rendering algorithm suitable
for interactive applications.

Compression Performance of the Xremote Protocol

//abstract
Abstract
The Xremote protocol is a compressed transformation of the X Window System protocol,
designed to efficiently implement X connections across relatively slow serial lines. Using an
Xremote simulator and 11 traces of X sessions, we found that Xremote's overall compression
ratio is 2.4:1. This figure varies widely depending on the trace. A study of compression
ratio as a function of message type shows text based messages commonly achieving 3:1
compression, while geometric messages usually achieve only 1.6:1 compression. By examining bandwidth requirements and compression performance as a function of time, we see
that Xremote performs adequately for some applications which are text based or which use
small geometric datasets, except at application startup where more bandwidth is required.
Further work is required to adequately support the initialization stage of X applications and
medium to large geometric databases.

Abstract
The aim of this paper is to identify and to characterize the features that render one class
of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) computationally more efficient. Our approach
is to search for a causal structure not only in the topology of the subsets of variables upon
which the constraints are specified, but also in the nature of the constraints. Basically, there
should exist an ordering of variables in the system such that an assignment of the variables
can be reached without backtracking. First, an approach of a causal structure is formulated,
and second, an efficient procedure is provided (i) for deciding if such an ordering of variables
exists and, (ii) for identifying such an ordering whenever possible.

Abstract. The current vehicle-highway system has reached a plateau in its ability
to meet the demand for moving goods and people. We sketch an architecture for
an automated highway system or AHS. The architecture can be realized by several
designs that differ in terms of performance and sophistication. We describe one design
that could triple capacity and reduce travel time; guarantee collision-free operation
in the absence of malfunctions; limit performance degradation in the case of faults;
and reduce emissions by half. We summarize evidence suggesting that the design can
be implemented. We indicate how the design can be adapted to different urban and
rural scenarios and how a standard land use model can show the impact of AHS on
urban density. We conclude with a critique of AHS.

Abstract: We exhibit a set of functions coded in
Haskell that can be used as building blocks to construct
a variety of interpreters for Lisp-like languages. The
building blocks are joined merely through functional
composition. Each building block contributes code to
support a specific feature, such as numbers, continuations, functions calls, or nondeterminism. The result of
composing some number of building blocks is a parser,
an interpreter, and a printer that support exactly the
expression forms and data types needed for the combined set of features, and no more.
The data structures are organized as pseudomonads,
a generalization of monads that allows composition.
Functional composition of the building blocks implies
type composition of the relevant pseudomonads.
Our intent was that the Haskell type resolution system ought to be able to deduce the approprate data
types automatically. Unfortunately there is a deficiency
in current Haskell implementations related to recursive
data types: circularity must be reflected statically in the
type definitions.
We circumvent this restriction by applying a purpose-built program simplifier that performs partial evaluation
and a certain amount of program algebra. We construct
a wide variety of interpreters in the style of Wadler by
starting with the building blocks and a page of boiler-plate code, writing three lines of code (one to specify the
building blocks and two to (redundantly) specify type
compositions), and then applying the simplifier. The
resulting code is acceptable Haskell code.
We have tested a dozen different interpreters with
various combinations of features. In this paper we discuss the overall code structuring strategy, exhibit several building blocks, briefly describe the partial evaluator, and present a number of automatically generated
interpreters.

Abstract
Multiple description coding (MDC) is source coding for multiple channels
such that a decoder which receives an arbitrary subset of the channels may produce a useful reconstruction. Orchard et al. [1] proposed a transform coding
method for MDC of pairs of independent Gaussian random variables. This paper provides a general framework which extends multiple description transform
coding (MDTC) to any number of variables and expands the set of transforms
which are considered. Analysis of the general case is provided, which can be
used to numerically design optimal MDTC systems. The case of two variables
sent over two channels is analytically optimized in the most general setting
where channel failures need not have equal probability or be independent. It
is shown that when channel failures are equally probable and independent, the
transforms used in [1] are in the optimal set, but many other choices are possible. A cascade structure is presented which facilitates low-complexity design,
coding, and decoding for a system with a large number of variables.

Quantized Overcomplete Expansions in R

//abstract
Abstract|Coefficient quantization has peculiar qualitative
effects on representations of vectors in R N with respect to
overcomplete sets of vectors. These effects are investigated
in two settings: frame expansions (representations obtained
by forming inner products with each element of the set)
and matching pursuit expansions (approximations obtained
by greedily forming linear combinations). In both cases,
based on the concept of consistency, it is shown that traditional linear reconstruction methods are suboptimal, and
better consistent reconstruction algorithms are given. The
proposed consistent reconstruction algorithms were in each
case implemented, and experimental results are included.
For frame expansions, results are proven to bound distortion as a function of frame redundancy r and quantization
step size for linear, consistent, and optimal reconstruction
methods. Taken together, these suggest that optimal reconstruction methods will yield O(1=r 2 ) MSE, and that consistency is sufficient to insure this asymptotic behavior. A
result on the asymptotic tightness of random frames is also
proven.
Applicability of quantized matching pursuit to lossy vector compression is explored. Experiments demonstrate the
likelihood that a linear reconstruction is inconsistent, the
MSE reduction obtained with a nonlinear (consistent) reconstruction algorithm, and generally competitive performance
at low bit rates.

Abstract
Applications of learning to autonomous
agents (simulated or real) have often been
restricted to learning a mapping from perceived state of the world to the next action
to take. Often this is couched in terms of
learning from no previous knowledge. This
general case for real autonomous robots is
very difficult. In any case, when building a
real robot there is usually a lot of a priori
knowledge (e.g., from the engineering that
went into its design) which doesn't need to
be learned. We describe the behavior-based
approach to autonomous robots, and then examine four classes of learning problems associated with such robots.

Predictions of lifetimes of dynamically allocated objects can be used
to improve time and space efficiency of dynamic memory management in computer programs. Barrett and Zorn [1993] used a simple
lifetime predictor and demonstrated this improvement on a variety
of computer programs. In this paper, we use decision trees to do
lifetime prediction on the same programs and show significantly
better prediction. Our method also has the advantage that during
training we can use a large number of features and let the decision
tree automatically choose the relevant subset.

Abstract
We describe a software package for computing and manipulating the subdivision of a sphere
by a collection of (not necessarily great) circles and for computing the boundary surface of the
union of spheres. We present problems that arise in the implementation of the software and the
solutions that we have found for them. At the core of the paper is a novel perturbation scheme to
overcome degeneracies and precision problems in computing spherical arrangements while using
floating point arithmetic. The scheme is relatively simple, it balances between the efficiency
of computation and the magnitude of the perturbation, and it performs well in practice. We
report and discuss experimental results. Our package is a major component in a larger package
aimed to support geometric queries on molecular models; it is currently employed by chemists
working in `rational drug design.' The spherical subdivisions are used to construct a geometric
model of a molecule where each sphere represents an atom. We also give an overview of the
molecular modeling package and detail additional features and implementation issues.

Abstract
It is obvious to anyone familiar with the rules of the game of chess
that a king on an empty board can reach every square. It is true, but
not obvious, that a knight can reach every square. Why is the first
fact obvious but the second fact not? This paper presents an analytic
theory of a class of obviousness judgments of this type. Whether or
not the specifics of this analysis are correct, it seems that the study of
obviousness judgments can be used to construct integrated theories of
linguistics, knowledge representation, and inference.

Abstract: We identify a new polynomial time decidable fragment of first order
logic and present a general method for using polynomial time inference procedures
in knowledge representation systems. Our results indicate that a non-standard
"taxonomic" syntax is essential in constructing natural and powerful polynomial
time inference procedures. The central role of taxonomic syntax in our polynomial time inference procedures provides technical support for the often expressed
intuition that knowledge is better represented in terms of taxonomic relationships
than classical first order formulas. To use our procedures in a knowledge representation system we define a "Socratic proof system" which is complete for first
order inference and which can be used as a semi-automated interface to a first
order knowledge base.

Complex Feature Recognition: A
Bayesian Approach for Learning to

Abstract
We have developed a new Bayesian framework for visual object
recognition which is based on the insight that images of objects can be
modeled as a conjunction of local features. This framework can be used
to both derive an object recognition algorithm and an algorithm for
learning the features themselves. The overall approach, called complex
feature recognition or CFR, is unique for several reasons: it is broadly
applicable to a wide range of object types, it makes constructing object
models easy, it is capable of identifying either the class or the identity
of an object, and it is computationally efficient requiring time proportional to the size of the image.
Instead of a single simple feature such as an edge, CFR uses a large
set of complex features that are learned from experience with model
objects. The response of a single complex feature contains much more
class information than does a single edge. This significantly reduces the
number of possible correspondences between the model and the image.
In addition, CFR takes advantage of a type of image processing called
oriented energy. Oriented energy is used to efficiently pre-process the
image to eliminate some of the difficulties associated with changes in
lighting and pose.

Abstract
The maximization of diversity of neuronal response properties has been recently suggested
as an organizing principle for the formation of such prominent features of the functional
architecture of the brain as the cortical columns and the associated patchy projection patterns
(Malach, 1994). We report a computational study of two aspects of this hypothesis. First, we
show that maximal diversity is attained when the ratio of dendritic and axonal arbor sizes is
equal to one, as it has been found in many cortical areas and across species (Lund et al., 1993;
Malach, 1994). Second, we show that maximization of diversity leads to better performance in
two case studies: in systems of receptive fields implementing steerable/shiftable filters, and in
matching spatially distributed signals, a problem that arises in visual tasks such as stereopsis,
motion processing, and recognition.

Abstract
Several early game-playing computer programs used forward pruning (i.e., the practice of
deliberately ignoring nodes that are believed unlikely to affect a game tree's minimax value),
but this technique did not seem to result in good decision-making. The poor performance of
forward pruning presents a major puzzle for AI research on game playing, because some version
of forward pruning seems to be "what people do," and the best chess-playing programs still do
not play as well as the best humans.
As a step toward deeper understanding of how forward pruning affects quality of play, in
this paper we set up a model of forward pruning on two abstract classes of binary game trees,
and we use this model to investigate how forward pruning affects the accuracy of the minimax
values returned. The primary result of our study is that forward pruning does better when there
is a high correlation among the minimax values of sibling nodes in a game tree.
This result suggests that forward pruning may possibly be a useful decision-making technique
in certain kinds of games. In particular, we believe that bridge may be such a game.

//abstract
Abstract
Model-Based Optimization (MBO) is a paradigm in which an objective function is used to express
both geometric and photometric constraints on features of interest. A parametric model of a feature
(such as a road, a building, or coastline) is extracted from one or more images by adjusting the model's
state variables until a minimum value of the objective function is obtained. The optimization procedure
yields a description that simultaneously satisfies (or nearly satisfies) all constraints, and, as a result, is
likely to be a good model of the feature.

Abstract
We describe an integrated problem solving architecture named INBANCA in
which Bayesian networks and case-based reasoning (CBR) work cooperatively on
multiagent planning tasks. This includes two-team dynamic tasks, and this paper
concentrates on simulated soccer as an example. Bayesian networks are used to characterize action selection whereas a case-based approach is used to determine how to
implement actions. This paper has two contributions. First, we survey integrations
of case-based and Bayesian approaches from the perspective of a popular CBR task
decomposition framework, thus explaining what types of integrations have been attempted. This allows us to explain the unique aspects of our proposed integration.
Second, we demonstrate how Bayesian nets can be used to provide environmental
context, and thus feature selection information, for the case-based reasoner.

THE LOAD, CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY OF QUORUM
SYSTEMS
//author
MONI NAOR AND AVISHAI WOOL
//abstract
Abstract.
A quorum system is a collection of sets (quorums) every two of which intersect. Quorum systems
have been used for many applications in the area of distributed systems, including mutual exclusion,
data replication and dissemination of information
Given a strategy to pick quorums, the load L(S) is the minimal access probability of the busiest
element, minimizing over the strategies. The capacity Cap(S) is the highest quorum accesses rate
that S can handle, so Cap(S) = 1=L(S).
The availability of a quorum system S is the probability that at least one quorum survives,
assuming that each element fails independently with probability p. A tradeoff between L(S) and the
availability of S is shown.
We present four novel constructions of quorum system, all featuring optimal or near optimal
load, and high availability. The best construction, based on paths in a grid, has a load of O(1=
p
and a failure probability of exp((
p
n)) when the elements fail with probability p &lt; 1
2 . Moreover,
even in the presence of faults, with exponentially high probability the load of this system is still
O(1=
n). The analysis of this scheme is based on Percolation Theory.

Abstract
A data breakpoint associates debugging actions with
programmer-specified conditions on the memory state
of an executing program. Data breakpoints provide
a means for discovering program bugs that are tedious or impossible to isolate using control breakpoints
alone. In practice, programmers rarely use data break-points, because they are either unimplemented or prohibitively slow in available debugging software. In this
paper, we present the design and implementation of a
practical data breakpoint facility.
A data breakpoint facility must monitor all memory
updates performed by the program being debugged.
We implemented and evaluated two complementary
techniques for reducing the overhead of monitoring
memory updates. First, we checked write instructions
by inserting checking code directly into the program
being debugged. The checks use a segmented bitmap
data structure that minimizes address lookup complexity. Second, we developed data flow algorithms
that eliminate checks on some classes of write instructions but may increase the complexity of the remaining
checks.
We evaluated these techniques on the Sparc using
the spec benchmarks. Checking each write instruc

overhead of 42%. This overhead is independent of the
number of breakpoints in use. Data flow analysis eliminated an average of 79% of the dynamic write checks.
For scientific programs such the nas kernels, analysis
reduced write checks by a factor of ten or more. On the
Sparc these optimizations reduced the average overhead to 25%.

Abstract
While plan recognition research has been applied to a
wide variety of problems, it has largely made identical assumptions about the number of agents participating in the plan, the observability of the plan execution process, and the scale of the domain. We describe a method for plan recognition in a real-world
domain involving large numbers of agents performing
spatial maneuvers in concert under conditions of limited observability. These assumptions differ radically
from those traditionally made in plan recognition and
produce a problem which combines aspects of the fields
of plan recognition, pattern recognition, and object
tracking. We describe our initial solution which borrows and builds upon research from each of these areas,
employing a pattern-directed approach to recognize individual movements and generalizing these to produce
inferences of large-scale behavior.

Abstract
Reactive controllers has been widely used in mobile robots since they are able to achieve successful performance in real-time. However, the configuration of a reactive controller depends
highly on the operating conditions of the robot and the environment; thus, a reactive controller
configured for one class of environments may not perform adequately in another. This paper
presents a formulation of learning adaptive reactive controllers. Adaptive reactive controllers
inherit all the advantages of traditional reactive controllers, but in addition they are able to adjust themselves to the current operating conditions of the robot and the environment in order to
improve task performance. Furthermore, learning adaptive reactive controllers can learn when
and how to adapt the reactive controller so as to achieve effective performance under different
conditions. The paper presents an algorithm for a learning adaptive reactive controller that
combines ideas from case-based reasoning and reinforcement learning to construct a mapping
between the operating conditions of a controller and the appropriate controller configuration;
this mapping is in turn used to adapt the controller configuration dynamically. As a case
study, the algorithm is implemented in a robotic navigation system that controls a Denning
MRV-III mobile robot. The system is extensively evaluated using statistical methods to verify
its learning performance and to understand the relevance of different design parameters on the
performance of the system.

Abstract
In this paper we develop a framework for comparing
ontologies, and place a number of the more
prominent ontologies into it. We have selected 10
specific projects for this study, including general
ontologies, domain specific ones, and one knowledge
representation system. The comparison framework
includes general characteristics such as the purpose of
an ontology, its coverage (general or domain-specific), its size, and the formalism used. It also
includes the design process used in creating an
ontology and the methods used to evaluate it.
Characteristics that describe the content of an
ontology include taxonomic organization, types of
concepts covered, top-level divisions, internal
structure of concepts, representation of part-whole
relations, and the presence and nature of additional
axioms. Finally we consider what experiments or
applications have used the ontologies. Knowledge
sharing and reuse will require a common framework
to support interoperability of independently created
ontologies. Our study shows there is great diversity
in the way ontologies are designed and the way they
represent the world. By identifying the similarities
and differences among existing ontologies, we clarify
the range of alternatives in creating a standard
framework for ontology design.

RESONANCE AND THE PERCEPTION OF

Abstract
Many connectionist approaches to musical expectancy and music composition let the
question of What next? overshadow the equally important question of When next?. One cannot
escape the latter question, one of temporal structure, when considering the perception of musical
meter. We view the perception of metrical structure as a dynamic process where the temporal
organization of external musical events synchronizes, or entrains, a listeners internal processing
mechanisms. This article introduces a novel connectionist unit, based upon a mathematical model
of entrainment, capable of phase and frequency-locking to periodic components of incoming
rhythmic patterns. Networks of these units can self-organize temporally structured responses to
rhythmic patterns. The resulting network behavior embodies the perception of metrical structure.
The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of our approach for theories of metrical
structure and musical expectancy.

Abstract
Advanced display technologies have made the virtual exploration of relatively complex models feasible
in many applications. Unfortunately, only a few human interfaces allow natural interaction with the
environment. Moreover, in surgical applications, such realistic interaction requires real-time rendering
of volumetric data - placing an overwhelming performance burden on the system. We report on a
collaboration of an interdisciplinary group developing a virtual reality system that provides intuitive
interaction with volume data by employing real-time volume rendering and force feedback (haptic)
sensations. We describe our rendering methods and the haptic devices and explain its utility of this
system in the real-world application of Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS) simulation.

Abstract
Grouping people into clusters based on the items they have purchased allows accurate recommendations of new items for purchase:
if you and I have liked many of the same movies, then I will probably enjoy other movies that you like. Recommending items based
on similarity of interest (a.k.a. collaborative filtering) is attractive
for many domains: books, CDs, movies, etc., but does not always
work well. Because data are always sparse any given person has
seen only a small fraction of all movies much more accurate predictions can be made by grouping people into clusters with similar
movies and grouping movies into clusters which tend to be liked by
the same people. Finding optimal clusters is tricky because the movie
groups should be used to help determine the people groups and visa
versa. We present a formal statistical model of collaborative filtering,
and compare different algorithms for estimating the model parameters
including variations of K-means clustering and Gibbs Sampling. This
formal model is easily extended to handle clustering of objects with
multiple attributes.

AUCTION-DRIVEN COORDINATION FOR
PLANTWIDE OPTIMIZATION

//abstract
Abstract
Model predictive control strategies generally focus on controlling plant outputs to setpoints; in
industry, however, a more desirable goal is maximizing a plants profitability. In principle, this can be
done by creating a plant model and maximizing profit with respect to the market prices of the plants
inputs and outputs, but in practice, such centralized approaches often cannot effectively be applied at
the operations time scale due to the size and complexity of the problem. One solution is to use
decentralized optimization at the unit operations level by tearing process streams and coordinating the
resulting pieces. Such optimization, however, requires that unit inputs and outputs be priced. We show
that a traditional Lagrangean-based approach to this pricing fails for simple systems. Instead, we define
slack resources over the torn process streams and price them using auctions. Unlike Lagrange
multipliers, slack resource prices contain useful information and can be used to make decisions
regarding capital improvements, thus providing a strong tie between the operations and management
layers in chemical plants.

ABSTRACT
Current input device taxonomies and other frameworks typically emphasize
the mechanical structure of input devices. We suggest that selecting an
appropriate input device for an interactive task requires looking beyond the
physical structure of devices to the deeper perceptual structure of the task, the
device, and the interrelationship between the perceptual structure of the task and
the control properties of the device. We affirm that perception is key to
understanding performance of multidimensional input devices on
multidimensional tasks. We have therefore extended the theory of processing of
perceptual structure to graphical interactive tasks and to the control structure of
input devices. This allows us to predict task and device combinations that lead to
better performance and hypothesize that performance is improved when the
perceptual structure of the task matches the control structure of the device. We
conducted an experiment in which subjects performed two tasks with different
perceptual structures, using two input devices with correspondingly different
control structures, a three-dimensional tracker and a mouse. We analyzed both
speed and accuracy, as well as the trajectories generated by subjects as they used
the unconstrained three-dimensional tracker to perform each task. The results
support our hypothesis and confirm the importance of matching the perceptual
structure of the task and the control structure of the input device.

Abstract
This paper defines a set of type inference rules for resolving overloading introduced by type classes. Programs including type classes
are transformed into ones which may be typed by the Hindley-Milner inference rules. In contrast to other work on type classes, the
rules presented here relate directly to user programs. An innovative
aspect of this work is the use of second-order lambda calculus to
record type information in the program.

Abstract
Let V and W be n-dimensional vector spaces over GF (2). A mapping
Q : V ! W is called crooked if it satisfies the following three properties:
Q(0) = 0;
Q(x) + Q() + Q() + Q(x + + ) 6= 0 for any three distinct x; ; ;
Q(x) + Q() + Q() + Q(x + a) + Q( + a) + Q( + a) 6= 0 if a 6= 0 (x; ;
arbitrary).
We show that every crooked function gives rise to a distance regular graph
of diameter 3 having = 0 and = 2 which is a cover of the complete
graph. Our approach is a generalization of a recent construction found by
de Caen, Mathon, and Moorhouse. We study graph-theoretical properties of
the resulting graphs, including their automorphisms. Also we demonstrate a
connection between crooked functions and bent functions.

Abstract
The use of music as a means to automate the sculpting and movement of graphical objects is investigated. An interactive environment for producing musically-controlled
computer animations is presented. The graphical objects studied are based on Todd's
and Latham's work in evolutionary art. The environment permits the creation of kernel objects using an interactive toolset. In addition to a basic set of morphological
definitions, each object incorporates a script, which is an instance of programming
language code and data definitions. Scripts permit the run-time computation of object characteristics, and when done in a temporal setting, allow complex animation
control. The script language has a number of functions that can access MIDI information, as read into the system via a MIDI file. The practical consequence of this
is that animations are controllable with music data, in which music determines the
movement and morphology of animated objects. The tight integration of music and
animation in an interactive production environment such as this one has a number
of pragmatic consequences, ranging from the ability to automatically synchronize
complex activities to music, to the use of music as a creative source for graphical
sculptoring and animation.

Summary
This article presents a software-only solution to the synchronization problem for uniprocessors.
The idea is to execute atomic sequences without any hardware protection, and in the rare case
of pre-emption, to roll the sequence forward to the end, thereby preserving atomicity. One of
the proposed implementations protects atomic sequences without any memory-accesses. This
is significant as it enables execution at CPU-speeds, rather than memory-speeds. The benefit of
this method increases with the frequency at which atomic sequences are executed. It therefore
encourages the building of systems with fine-grained synchronization. This has the additional
advantage of reducing average latency. Experiments demonstrate that this technique has the
potential to outperform even the best hardware mechanisms. The main contribution of this article
is to discuss operating-system related issues of rollforward and to demonstrate its practicality,
both in terms of flexibility and performance.

Abstract
Conventional software radios take advantage of vastly improved A/D converters and DSP hardware. Our
approach, which we refer to as virtual radios, also depends upon high performance A/D converters. However,
rather than use DSPs, we have chosen to ride the curve of rapidly improving workstation hardware. We use
wideband digitization and then perform all of the digital signal processing in user space on a general purpose
workstation. This approach allows us to experiment with new approaches to signal processing that exploit the
hardware and software resources of the workstation. Furthermore, it allows us to experiment with different
ways of structuring systems in which the radio component of communication devices are integrated with
higher-level applications.
This paper describes the design and performance of an environment we have constructed that facilitates building virtual radios and of two applications built using that environment. The environment consists of an I/O
subsystem that provides high bandwidth low latency user-level access to digitized signals and a programming
environment that provides an infrastructure for building applications. The applications, which exemplify
some of the benefits of virtual radios, are a software cellular receiver and a novel wireless network interface.

Abstract. Myrinet is a new type of local-area network (LAN) based on the
technology used for packet communication and switching within "massively-parallel processors" (MPPs). Think of Myrinet as an MPP message-passing
network that can span campus dimensions, rather than as a wide-area
telecommunications network that is operating in close quarters. The
technical steps toward making Myrinet a reality included the development
of (1) robust, 25m communication channels with flow control, packet
framing, and error control; (2) self-initializing, low-latency, cut-through
switches; (3) host interfaces that can map the network, select routes, and
translate from network addresses to routes, as well as handle packet traffic;
and (4) streamlined host software that allows direct communication
between user processes and the network.

with the rest of the system. We discuss an architecture suitable for environments that
(potentially) consist of systems of heterogeneous hardware and software architectures.
The result is a page-based system in which the fundamental notion is that of mapping

Abstract
The correspondence problem in computer vision is basically a matching task between two or more sets of features. In this paper, we introduce a vectorized image
representation, which is a feature-based representation
where correspondence has been established with respect
to a reference image. The representation consists of two
image measurements made at the feature points: shape
and texture. Feature geometry, or shape, is represented
using the (x; ) locations of features relative to the some
standard reference shape. Image grey levels, or texture,
are represented by mapping image grey levels onto the
standard reference shape. Computing this representation
is essentially a correspondence task, and in this paper
we explore an automatic technique for "vectorizing" face
images. Our face vectorizer alternates back and forth
between computation steps for shape and texture, and a
key idea is to structure the two computations so that each
one uses the output of the other. In addition to describing the vectorizer, an application to the problem of facial
feature detection will be presented.

ABSTRACT
Multipol is a library of distributed data structures designed for irregular applications, including those with asynchronous communication patterns. In this paper,
we describe the Multipol runtime layer, which provides an efficient and portable abstraction underlying the data structures. It contains a thread system to express
computations with varying degrees of parallelism and to support multiple threads
per processor for hiding communication latency. To simplify programming in a mul-tithreaded environment, Multipol threads are small, finite-length computations that
are executed atomically. Rather than enforcing a single scheduling policy on threads,
users may write their own schedulers or choose one of the schedulers provided by
Multipol. The system is designed for distributed memory architectures and performs
communication optimizations such as message aggregation to improve efficiency on
machines with high communication startup overhead. The runtime system currently
runs on the Thinking Machines CM5, Intel Paragon, and IBM SP1, and is being
ported to a network of workstations. Multipol applications include an event-driven
timing simulator [1], an eigenvalue solver [2], and a program that solves the phylogeny
problem [3].

Narrowing Interval Bounds
//abstract
1. Abstract
Interval arithmetic is an automated attempt to give guaranteed upper and lower bounds of a numerical
computation in the face of uncertainly in the input data and floating point roundoff during the calculation.
While a simple interval equivalent of a rational function can be readily synthesized, the bounds from this
construction may be too pessimistically large to be useful. This paper surveys a variety of techniques for
refining the interval bounds. An appendix identifies issues with realizing floating point based interval
arithmetic on current IEEE 754 compliant processors.

Abstract
We present an approach for creating realistic synthetic views of existing architectural
scenes from a sparse set of still photographs. Our approach, which combines both geometry-based and image-based modeling and rendering techniques, has two components. The first
component is an easy-to-use photogrammetric modeling system which facilitates the recovery of a basic geometric model of the photographed scene. The modeling system is effective
and robust because it exploits the constraints that are characteristic of architectural scenes.
The second component is a model-based stereo algorithm, which recovers how the real scene
deviates from the basic model. By making use of the model, our stereo approach can robustly
recover accurate depth from image pairs with large baselines. Consequently, our approach
can model large architectural environments with far fewer photographs than current image-based modeling approaches. As an intermediate result, we present view-dependent texture
mapping, a method of better simulating geometric detail on basic models. Our approach
can recover models for use in either geometry-based or image-based rendering systems. We
present results that demonstrate our approach's abilty to create realistic renderings of architectural scenes from viewpoints far from the original photographs.

Abstract. Object-Relational and Object-Oriented DBMSs allow
users to invoke time-consuming (expensive) methods in their
queries. When queries containing these expensive methods are run
on data with duplicate values, time is wasted redundantly computing methods on the same value. This problem has been studied in
the context of programming languages, where memoization is the
standard solution. In the database literature, sorting has been proposed to deal with this problem. We compare these approachesalong
with a third solution, a variant of unary hybrid hashing which we call
Hybrid Cache. We demonstrate that Hybrid Cache always dominates memoization, and significantly outperforms sorting in many
instances. This provides new insights into the tradeoff between hashing and sorting for unary operations. Additionally, our Hybrid Cache
algorithm includes some new optimizations for unary hybrid hashing, which can be used for other applications such as grouping and
duplicate elimination. We conclude with a discussion of techniques
for caching multiple expensive methods in a single query, and raise
some new optimization problems in choosing caching techniques.

Using Skeletons for Nonholonomic Path Planning among Obstacles

//abstract
Abstract
This paper describes a practical path planner for
nonholonomic robots in environments with obstacles.
The planner is based on building a one-dimensional,
maximal clearance skeleton through the configuration
space of the robot. However rather than using the Eu-clidean metric to determine clearance, a special metric
which captures information about the nonholonomy of
the robot is used. The robot navigates from start to
goal states by loosely following the skeleton; the resulting paths taken by the robot are of low "complexity."
We describe how much of the computation can be done
off-line once and for all for a given robot, making for
an efficient planner. The focus is on path planning
for mobile robots, particularly the planar two-axle car,
but the underlying ideas are quite general and may be
applied to planners for other nonholonomic robots.

Abstract
The problem of belief changehow an agent should revise her beliefs upon learning new
informationhas been an active area of research in both philosophy and artificial intelligence.
Many approaches to belief change have been proposed in the literature. Our goal is not to
introduce yet another approach, but to examine carefully the rationale underlying the approaches
already taken in the literature, and to highlight what we view as methodological problems in the
literature. The main message is that to study belief change carefully, we must be quite explicit
about the ontology or scenario underlying the belief change process. This is something that
has been missing in previous work, with its focus on postulates. Our analysis shows that we
must pay particular attention to two issues which have often been taken for granted: The first
is how we model the agent's epistemic state. (Do we use a set of beliefs, or a richer structure,
such as an ordering on worlds? And if we use a set of beliefs, in what language are these
beliefs are expressed?) The second is the status of observations. (Are observations known to
be true, or just believed? In the latter case, how firm is the belief?) For example, we argue that
even postulates that have been called beyond controversy are unreasonable when the agent's
beliefs include beliefs about her own epistemic state as well as the external world. Issues of the
status of observations arise particularly when we consider iterated belief revision, and we must
confront the possibility of revising by ' and then by :'.

Abstract
Conditional logics play an important role in recent attempts
to investigate default reasoning. This paper investigates first-order conditional logic. We show that, as for first-order
probabilistic logic, it is important not to confound statistical conditionals over the domain (such as most birds fly),
and subjective conditionals over possible worlds (such as I
believe that Tweety is unlikely to fly). We then address
the issue of ascribing semantics to first-order conditional
logic. As in the propositional case, there are many possible semantics. To study the problem in a coherent way, we
use plausibility structures. These provide us with a general
framework in which many of the standard approaches can be
embedded. We show that while these standard approaches
are all the same at the propositional level, they are significantly different in the context of a first-order language. We
show that plausibilities provide the most natural extension of
conditional logic to the first-order case: We provide a sound
and complete axiomatization that contains only the KLM
properties and standard axioms of first-order modal logic.
We show that most of the other approaches have additional
properties, which result in an inappropriate treatment of an
infinitary version of the lottery paradox.

Multi-threaded programming is difficult and error prone. It
is easy to make a mistake in synchronization that produces a
data race, yet it can be extremely hard to locate this mistake
during debugging. This paper describes a new tool, called
Eraser, for dynamically detecting data races in lock-based
multi-threaded programs. Eraser uses binary rewriting techniques to monitor every shared memory reference and verify
that consistent locking behavior is observed. We present several case studies, including undergraduate coursework and a
multi-threaded Web search engine, that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

Abstract
We report the performance of NOW-Sort, a collection of sorting implementations on a Network of Workstations (NOW).
We find that parallel sorting on a NOW is competitive to sorting on the large-scale SMPs that have traditionally held the
performance records. On a 64-node cluster, we sort 6.0 GB
in just under one minute, while a 32-node cluster finishes the
Datamation benchmark in 2.41 seconds.
Our implementations can be applied to a variety of disk,
memory, and processor configurations; we highlight salient
issues for tuning each component of the system. We evaluate the use of commodity operating systems and hardware for
parallel sorting. We find existing OS primitives for memory
management and file access adequate. Due to aggregate communication and disk bandwidth requirements, the bottleneck
of our system is the workstation I/O bus.

Abstract
This paper examines the plausibility of using a network of
workstations (NOW) for a mixture of parallel and sequential
jobs. Through simulations, our study examines issues that arise
when combining these two workloads on a single platform. Starting from a dedicated NOW just for parallel programs, we incrementally relax uniprogramming restrictions until we have a
multi-programmed, multi-user NOW for both interactive sequential users and parallel programs. We show that a number of issues
associated with the distributed NOW environment (e.g., daemon
activity, coscheduling skew) can have a small but noticeable effect on parallel program performance. We also find that efficient
migration to idle workstations is necessary to maintain acceptable parallel application performance. Furthermore, we present a
methodology for deriving an optimal delay time for recruiting idle
machines for use by parallel programs; this recruitment threshold
was just 3 minutes for the research cluster we measured. Finally,
we quantify the effects of the additional parallel load upon interactive users by keeping track of the potential number of user
delays in our simulations. When we limit the maximum number
of delays per user, we can still maintain acceptable parallel program performance. In summary, we find that for our workloads a
2:1 rule applies: a NOW cluster of approximately 60 machines can
sustain a 32-node parallel workload in addition to the sequential
load placed upon it by interactive users.

Stochastic Interaction and Linear Logic

//abstract
Abstract
We present stochastic interactive semantics for propositional linear
logic without modalities. The framework is based on interactive
protocols considered in computational complexity theory, in which
a prover with unlimited power interacts with a verifier that can
only toss fair coins or perform simple tasks when presented with
the given formula or with subsequent messages from the prover.
The additive conjunction & is described as random choice, which
reflects the intuitive idea that the verifier can perform only "random spot checks". This stochastic interactive semantic framework
is shown to be sound and complete. Furthermore, the prover's
winning strategies are basically proofs of the given formula. In
this framework the multiplicative and additive connectives of linear logic are described by means of probabilistic operators, giving a
new basis for intuitive reasoning about linear logic and a potential
new tool in automated deduction.

Abstract
In this paper we present an extensive experimental study comparing three general-purpose graph
drawing algorithms. The three algorithms take as
input general graphs (with no restrictions whatsoever on the connectivity, planarity, etc.) and construct orthogonal grid drawings, which are widely
used in software and database visualization applications. The test data (available by anonymous
ftp) are 11,582 graphs, ranging from 10 to 100
vertices, which have been generated from a core
set of 112 graphs used in "real-life" software engineering and database applications. The experiments provide a detailed quantitative evaluation of
the performance of the three algorithms, and show
that they exhibit trade-offs between "aesthetic"
properties (e.g., crossings, bends, edge length) and
running time. The observed practical behavior of
the algorithms is consistent with their theoretical
properties.

We are interested in efficiently accessing data in an object-oriented database.
We have developed a query algebra which fully supports object identity and
abstract data types, and have identified a variety of algebraic query transformations. The equivalence of two queries is complicated by the presence of
object identity. In this paper we define a hierarchy of notions of equivalence
for queries, and present examples of equivalent query transformations for each
level of the hierarchy.

Abstract
Relational database systems and most object-oriented database systems provide support for queries.
Usually these queries represent retrievals over sets or
multisets. Many new applications for databases, such
as multimedia systems and digital libraries, need support for queries on complex bulk types such as lists
and trees. In this paper we describe an object-oriented
query algebra for lists and trees. The operators in the
algebra preserve the ordering between the elements of a
list or tree, even when the result list or tree contains an
arbitrary set of nodes from the original tree. We also
present predicate languages for lists and trees which
allow order-sensitive queries because they use pattern
matching to examine groups of list or tree nodes rather
than individual nodes. The ability to decompose predicate patterns enables optimizations that make use of
indices.

Abstract
This paper is concerned with modeling
planning problems involving uncertainty as
discrete-time, finite-state stochastic automata.
Solving planning problems is reduced to computing policies for Markov decision processes.
Classical methods for solving Markov decision
processes cannot cope with the size of the
state spaces for typical problems encountered
in practice. As an alternative, we investigate
methods that decompose global planning problems into a number of local problems, solve the
local problems separately, and then combine
the local solutions to generate a global solution. We present algorithms that decompose
planning problems into smaller problems given
an arbitrary partition of the state space. The
local problems are interpreted as Markov decision processes and solutions to the local problems are interpreted as policies restricted to the
subsets of the state space defined by the partition. One algorithm relies on constructing and
solving an abstract version of the original decision problem. A second algorithm iteratively
approximates parameters of the local problems
to converge to an optimal solution. We show
how properties of a specified partition affect the
time and storage required for these algorithms.

//abstract
We are concerned with temporal reasoning problems where there is uncertainty about the order
in which events occur. The task of temporal reasoning is to derive an event sequence consistent with
a given set of ordering constraints to achieve a goal. Previous research shows that the associated
decision problems are hard even for very restricted cases. In this paper, we investigate locality in
event ordering and causal dependencies. We present a localized temporal reasoning algorithm that
uses subgoals and abstract events to exploit locality. The computational efficiency of our algorithm
for a problem instance is quantified by the inherent locality in the instance. We theoretically
demonstrate the substantial improvement in performance gained by exploiting locality. This work
provides a solid evidence of the usefulness of localized reasoning in exploiting locality.

Abstract
We investigate the use of temporally abstract
actions, or macro-actions, in the solution of
Markov decision processes. Unlike current models that combine both primitive actions and
macro-actions and leave the state space unchanged, we propose a hierarchical model (using
an abstract MDP) that works with macro-actions
only, and that significantly reduces the size of the
state space. This is achieved by treating macro-actions as local policies that act in certain regions
of state space, and by restricting states in the abstract MDP to those at the boundaries of regions.
The abstract MDP approximates the original and
can be solved more efficiently. We discuss several ways in which macro-actions can be generated to ensure good solution quality. Finally,
we consider ways in which macro-actions can be
reused to solve multiple, related MDPs; and we
show that this can justify the computational over
head of macro-action generation.

Abstract
This paper investigates the power of genetic algorithms at solving the MAX-CLIQUE problem. We measure the performance of a standard genetic algorithm on an elementary set of
problem instances consisting of embedded cliques in random graphs. We indicate the need
for improvement, and introduce a new genetic algorithm, the multi-phase annealed GA, which
exhibits superior performance on the same problem set.
As we scale up the problem size and test on "hard" benchmark instances, we notice a
degraded performance in the algorithm caused by premature convergence to local minima. To
alleviate this problem, a sequence of modifications are implemented ranging from changes in
input representation to systematic local search. The most recent version, called union GA,
incorporates the features of union cross-over, greedy replacement, and diversity enhancement.
It shows a marked speed-up in the number of iterations required to find a given solution, as well
as some improvement in the clique size found.
We discuss issues related to the SIMD implementation of the genetic algorithms on a Thinking Machines CM-5, which was necessitated by the intrinsically high time complexity (O(n 3 ))
of the serial algorithm for computing one iteration.
Our preliminary conclusions are: (1) a genetic algorithm needs to be heavily customized to
work "well" for the clique problem; (2) a GA is computationally very expensive, and its use is
only recommended if it is known to find larger cliques than other algorithms; (3) although our
customization effort is bringing forth continued improvements, there is no clear evidence, at this
time, that a GA will have better success in circumventing local minima.

ABSTRACT:
In this paper, we overview the implementation of TCP Boston
a novel fragmentation-tolerant transport protocol, especially
suited for ATM's 53-byte cell-oriented switching architecture.
TCP Boston integrates a standard TCP/IP protocol, such as
Reno or Vegas, with a powerful redundancy control mechanism based on AIDAan adaptive version of Rabin's IDA dispersal and reconstruction algorithms. Our results show that
TCP Boston improves TCP/IP's performance over ATMs for
both network-centric metrics (e.g., effective throughput) and
application-centric metrics (e.g., response time).

Abstract
The purpose of these notes is to describe some of the physical and mathematical properties
of the equations occurring in global illumination. We first examine the physical assumptions
that make the particle model of light an appropriate paradigm for computer graphics and
then derive a balance equation for photons. In doing this we establish connections with the
field of radiative transfer and its more abstract counterpart, transport theory. The resulting
balance equation, known as the equation of transfer, accounts for large-scale interaction
of light with participating media as well as complex reflecting surfaces. Under various
simplifying assumptions the equation of transfer reduces to more conventional equations
encountered in global illumination.

In this paper, we present an approach for the reconstruction of teeth model. Therefore,
a tooth model has to be scanned from several directions with a 3D-laser scanner. Several
views are necessary because of shadows and occluded areas in the range images. Then,
all acquired range views are combined to build a CAD-model of the tooth. The idea is
that every part of the surface should be visible in at least one view. The reconstruction
process is divided into the steps registration, volume sculpturing and generation of an
accurate polygonal representation.

//abstract
Abstract
Industrial assembly involves sensing the pose (orientation and position) of a part. Efficient and reliable
sensing strategies can be developed for an assembly
task if the shape of the part is known in advance. In
this paper we investigate the problem of determining
the pose of a convex n-gon from a set of m supporting
cones, i.e., cones with both sides supporting the polygon. An algorithm with running time O(nm) which
almost always reduces to O(n + m log n) is presented
to solve for all possible poses of the polygon. As a consequence, the polygon inscription problem of finding all
possible poses for a convex n-gon inscribed in another
convex m-gon, can be solved within the same asymptotic time bound. We prove that the number of possible poses cannot exceed 6n, given m 2 supporting
cones with distinct vertices. Experiments demonstrate
that two supporting cones are sufficient to determine
the real pose of the n-gon in most cases.
Our results imply that sensing in practice can be
carried out by obtaining viewing angles of a planar
part at multiple exterior sites in the plane. As a conclusion, we generalize this and other sensing methods
into a scheme named sensing by inscription.

Abstract
The theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a deficient
domain theory using information contained in examples that expose inaccuracies. In this paper we
present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories. The
approach described here, called PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to
numerically track the ``ow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the precise
role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given
example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair awed elements of the theory.
PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown
experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories.

Abstract:
Current and emerging real-time and multimedia applications like multi-party collaboration, internet telephony and
distributed command control systems require the exchange of information over distributed and heterogeneous nodes.
Multiple data types including voice, video, sensor data, real-time intelligence data and text are being transported
widely across today's information, control and surveillance networks. All such applications can benefit enormously
from middleware, operating system and networking services that can support QoS guarantees, high availability,
dynamic reconfigurability and scalability.
In this paper, we propose a middleware layer called a "Real-Time Push-Pull Communications Service" to easily and quickly disseminate information across heterogeneous nodes with an underlying architecture to satisfy the
above-mentioned requirements. Push-Pull Communications is an extension of the real-time publisher/subscriber
model [4], and represents both "push" (data transfer initiated by a sender) and "pull" (data transfer initiated by a
receiver) communications. Nodes with widely differing processing power and networking bandwidth can coordinate
and co-exist by the provision of appropriate and automatic support for transformation on data and supports scaling.
Different information sources and sinks can operate at different frequencies and also can choose another (intermedi-ate) node to act as their proxy and and deliver data at the desired frequency. This service has been implemented
on RT-Mach, a resource-centric kernel using resource kernel primitives [7]. This paper presents an overview of the
design, implementation and preliminary performance evaluation of the model.

Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing tries to select a path that satisfies a set of
QoS constraints, while also achieving overall network resource efficiency. We
present initial results on QoS path selection for traffic requiring bandwidth
and delay guarantees. For traffic with bandwidth guarantees, we found that
several routing algorithms that favor paths with fewer hops perform well. For
traffic with delay guarantees, we show that for a broad class of WFQ-like
scheduling algorithms, the problem of finding a path satisfying bandwidth,
delay, delay-jitter, and/or buffer space constraints while at the same time
deriving the bandwidth that has to be reserved to meet these constraints, is
solvable by a modified version of the Bellman-Ford shortest-path algorithm
in polynomial time.

Abstract
Abstraction is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of problem
solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description as
used in most hierarchical planners has proven useful. In this paper we present examples
which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome
these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of
representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related
sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation
language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful
change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which
describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model.
This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement
in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically
learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning
in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from
abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.

Abstract
The FAA Aging Aircraft Research Program is
supporting the development of a robotic mobile
nondestructive inspection (NDI) instrument
deployment tool at Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU) with the active participation of USAir. The
program has spawned several new relationships
and entities: an alliance with an ARPA-funded
research program at CMU having the capability to
add 3D-stereoscopic enhanced visual inspection
capability, a start-up company organized to
commercialize the combined technologies, and
State of Pennsylvania funding to foster this
commercialization. As a result of these activities
and connections the civilian sector appears to be
ahead of the military sector in important aspects of
automation for deployment of aircraft inspection
equipment. A partnership between the university
researchers, the airline operator, the start-up
company, and the state government is thus
emerging as the likely agent for transfer of the
civilian-developed technology to the military sector.

Abstract
Because the World Wide Web consists primarily of
text, information extraction is central to any effort that
would use the Web as a resource for knowledge discovery. We show how information extraction can be cast
as a standard machine learning problem, and argue for
the suitability of relational learning in solving it. The
implementation of a general-purpose relational learner
for information extraction, SRV, is described. In contrast with earlier learning systems for information extraction, SRV makes no assumptions about document
structure and the kinds of information available for use
in learning extraction patterns. Instead, structural and
other information is supplied as input in the form of an
extensible token-oriented feature set. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach by adapting SRV for
use in learning extraction rules for a domain consisting
of university course and research project pages sampled
from the Web. Making SRV Web-ready only involves
adding several simple HTML-specific features to its basic feature set.

We present an overview of Candide, a system for automatic
translation of French text to English text. Candide uses
methods of information theory and statistics to develop a
probability model of the translation process. This model,
which is made to accord as closely as possible with a large
body of French and English sentence pairs, is then used to
generate English translations of previously unseen French
sentences. This paper provides a tutorial in these methods,
discussions of the training and operation of the system, and
a summary of test results.

Abstract. The design of linear logic programming languages and theorem provers opens a number of new implementation challenges not
present in more traditional logic languages such as Horn clauses (Prolog)
and hereditary Harrop formulas (Prolog). Among these, the problem of
efficiently managing the linear context when solving a goal is of crucial
importance for the use of these systems in non-trivial applications. This
paper studies this problem in the case of Lolli [6] (though its results have
application to other systems). We first give a proof-theoretic presentation of the operational semantics of this language as a resolution calculus.
We then present a series of resource management systems designed to
eliminate the non-determinism in the distribution of linear formulas that
undermines the efficiency of a direct implementation of this system.

Fast Probabilistic Modeling for Combinatorial Optimization
//abstract
Abstract
Probabilistic models have recently been utilized for the optimization of large combinatorial search problems. However,
complex probabilistic models that attempt to capture inter-parameter dependencies can have prohibitive computational
costs. The algorithm presented in this paper, termed
COMIT, provides a method for using probabilistic models in
conjunction with fast search techniques. We show how
COMIT can be used with two very different fast search algorithms: hillclimbing and Population-based incremental
learning (PBIL). The resulting algorithms maintain many of
the benefits of probabilistic modeling, with far less computational expense. Extensive empirical results are provided;
COMIT has been successfully applied to jobshop scheduling, traveling salesman, and knapsack problems. This paper
also presents a review of probabilistic modeling for combi
natorial optimization.

New Approximation Techniques for Some Ordering Problems
//author
Satish Rao Andrea W. Richa
//abstract
Abstract
We describe logarithmic times optimal approximation
algorithms for the NP-hard graph optimization problems of minimum linear arrangement, minimum containing interval graph, and minimum storage-time
product. This improves on the best previous approximation bounds of Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber for
these problems by an (log log n) factor.
Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber defined "spreading
metrics" for each of the ordering problems above (and
to other problems); for each of these problems, they
provided a spreading metric of volume W , such that W
is a lower bound on the cost of a solution to the problem.
They used this spreading metric to find a solution of
cost O(W log n log log n) (for simplicity, assume that
all tasks have unit processing time in the minimum
storage-time product problem). In this paper, we show
how to find a solution within a logarithmic factor times
W for these problems.
We develop a recursion where at each level we
identify cost which, if incurred, yields subproblems
with reduced spreading metric volume. Specifically, we
present a divide-and-conquer strategy where the cost of
a solution to a problem at a recursive level is C plus the
cost of a solution to the subproblems at this level, and
where the spreading metric volume on the subproblems
is less than the original volume by (C= log n). This
ensures that the resulting solution has cost O(log n)
times the original spreading metric volume.
We note that this is an existentially tight bound on
the relationship between the spreading metric volume
W and the true optimal values for these problems.
For planar graphs, we combine a structural theorem
of Klein, Plotkin, and Rao with our new recursion technique to show that the spreading metric cost volumes
are within an O(log log n) factor of the cost of an optimal solution for the minimum linear arrangement, and
the minimum containing interval graph problems.

Abstract.
Rogue is an architecture built on a real robot which provides algorithms for the integration of high-level planning, low-level robotic execution, and learning. Rogue addresses successfully several of the
challenges of a dynamic office gopher environment. This article presents the techniques for the integration
of planning and execution.
Rogue uses and extends a classical planning algorithm to create plans for multiple interacting goals
introduced by asynchronous user requests. Rogue translates the planner's actions to robot execution
actions and monitors real world execution. Rogue is currently implemented using the prodigy4.0
planner and the Xavier robot. This article describes how plans are created for multiple asynchronous goals,
and how task priority and compatibility information is used to achieve appropriate efficient execution. We
describe how Rogue communicates with the planner and the robot to interleave planning with execution
so that the planner can replan for failed actions, identify the actual outcome of an action with multiple
possible outcomes, and take opportunities from changes in the environment.
Rogue represents a successful integration of a classical artificial intelligence planner with a real mobile
robot.

Abstract
The World Wide Web (WWW) has recently become a very popular facility for the dissemination of
information. As a result of this popularity, it is experiencing rapidly increasing traffic load. Single
machine servers cannot keep pace with the ever greater load being placed upon them. To alleviate this
problem, we have implemented a distributed Web server group. The server group can effectively balance request load amongst its members (within about 10% of optimal), and client response time is no
worse than in the single server case. Client response time was not improved because the measured client traffic consumed all available network throughput. The distributed operation of the server groups is
completely transparent to standard Web clients.

Abstract
Multimedia has generated widespread interest in real-time support within general purpose
operating systems. Multimedia also places new demands on operating systems for interprocess
communication. The Multimedia Testbed is a set of applications that stress consistent low-latency response and efficient interprocess communication for large blocks of data. The
Multimedia Testbed was ported to Real-Time Mach in the hopes of providing predictable low-latency response and, consequently, good synchronization and low jitter as required for
multimedia applications. Our work compares the performance of Real-Time Mach with that of
Mach 3.0. Although the fixed-priority scheduling of Real-Time Mach is a substantial
improvement, user threads are still preempted by device drivers, and the overall real-time
performance is not suitable for multimedia applications. We discuss areas where Real-Time
Mach needs improvement.

Abstract
This paper describes an end-to-end method for extracting moving targets from a real-time video stream,
classifying them into predefined categories according
to image-based properties, and then robustly tracking
them. Moving targets are detected using the pixelwise
difference between consecutive image frames. A classi-ficatoin metric is applied these targets with a temporal
consistency constraint to classify them into three categories: human, vehicle or background clutter. Once
classified, targets are tracked by a combination of temporal differencing and template matching.
The resulting system robustly identifies targets of
interest, rejects background clutter, and continually
tracks over large distances and periods of time despite
occlusions, appearance changes and cessation of target
motion.

Abstract
Weak connectivity, in the form of intermittent, low-bandwidth, or expensive networks is a fact of life in mobile computing.
In this paper, we describe how the Coda File System has evolved to exploit such networks. The underlying theme of this
evolution has been the systematic introduction of adaptivity to eliminate hidden assumptions about strong connectivity.
Many aspects of the system, including communication, cache validation, update propagation and cache miss handling have
been modified. As a result, Coda is able to provide good performance even when network bandwidth varies over four orders
of magnitude from modem speeds to LAN speeds.

Abstract.
This paper presents an analysis of the following load balancing algorithm. At each step, each node in a network examines the number
of tokens at each of its neighbors and sends a token to each neighbor with at least 2d + 1 fewer tokens, where d is the maximum degree
of any node in the network. We show that within O(=ff) steps, the algorithm reduces the maximum difference in tokens between any
two nodes to at most O((d 2 log n)=ff), where is the global imbalance in tokens (i.e., the maximum difference between the number of
tokens at any node initially and the average number of tokens), n is the number of nodes in the network, and ff is the edge expansion of
the network. The time bound is tight in the sense that for any graph with edge expansion ff, and for any value , there exists an initial
distribution of tokens with imbalance for which the time to reduce the imbalance to even =2 is at least (=ff). The bound on the
final imbalance is tight in the sense that there exists a class of networks that can be locally balanced everywhere (i.e., the maximum
difference in tokens between any two neighbors is at most 2d), while the global imbalance remains ((d 2 log n)=ff). Furthermore, we show
that upon reaching a state with a global imbalance of O((d 2 log n)=ff), the time for this algorithm to locally balance the network can be
as large as (n 1=2 ). We extend our analysis to a variant of this algorithm for dynamic and asynchronous networks. We also present tight
bounds for a randomized algorithm in which each node sends at most one token in each step.

Abstract
This paper describes a media-independent, compositional, plan-based approach to representing attributive descriptions for use in integrated text and graphics generation. An attributive
description's main function is to convey information directly contributing to the communicative
goals of a discourse, whereas a referential description's only function is to enable the audience
to identify a particular referent. This approach has been implemented as part of an architecture
for generating integrated text and information graphics. Uses of referential and attributive descriptions are represented as two distinct types of communicative acts in a media-independent
plan. It is particularly important to distinguish the two types of acts, since they have different
consequences for dialogue and text generation, and for graphic design.

Abstract.
We describe a simple reduction from the problem of PAC-learning from multiple-instance examples to that of PAC-learning with one-sided random classification noise. Thus, all concept classes
learnable with one-sided noise, which includes all concepts learnable in the usual 2-sided random
noise model plus others such as the parity function, are learnable from multiple-instance examples. We also describe a more efficient (and somewhat technically more involved) reduction to
the Statistical-Query model that results in a polynomial-time algorithm for learning axis-parallel
rectangles with sample complexity ~ O(d 2 r=* 2 ), saving roughly a factor of r over the results of Auer
et al. (1997).

//abstract
Abstract. In this paper we describe a new method for automated tuning of high level parameters of supervised
learning systems. It uses memory-based learning principles and follows certain ideas of experimental design. The
described method allows not only for an efficient search through a decision space, but also for a concurrent validation
of the learning algorithm performance on a given data. Potential usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated
with the Fuzzy-ARTMAP neural network application to learning a qualitative positioning of an indoor mobile robot
equipped with sonar range sensors. Automatically selected neural network setpoints reach a comparable performance
to those achieved by human experts in relatively simple 2D cases. Migration of the proposed method to higher order
optimization domains bears a big promise, but requires further research.

Abstract
Physically-based modeling has been used in the past to support a variety of interactive modeling tasks including free-form surface design, mechanism design, constrained drawing, and interactive camera control. In these systems, the user interacts with the model
by exerting virtual forces, to which the system responds subject
to the active constraints. In the past, this kind of interaction has
been applicable only to models that are governed by continuous
parameters. In this paper we present an extension to mixed con-tinuous/discrete models, emphasizing constrained layout problems
that arise in architecture and other domains. When the object being
dragged is blocked from further motion by geometric constraints, a
local discrete search is triggered, during which transformations such
as swapping of adjacent objects may be performed. The result of the
search is a nearby state in which the target object has been moved
in the indicated direction and in which all constraints are satisfied.
The transition to this state is portrayed using simple but effective animated visual effects. Following the transition, continuous dragging
is resumed. The resulting seamless transitions between discrete and
continuous manipulation allow the user to easily explore the mixed
design space just by dragging objects. We demonstrate the method
in application to architectural floor plan design, circuit board layout,
art analysis, and page layout.

Abstract
Increased reliance on agile manufacturing techniques has created a demand for systems to solve integrated process-planning
and production-scheduling problems in large-scale dynamic environments. To be effective, these systems should provide user-oriented interactive functionality for managing the various user
tasks and objectives and reacting to unexpected events. This paper describes the mixed-initiative problem-solving features of
IP3S, an Integrated Process-Planning/Production-Scheduling
shell for agile manufacturing. IP3S is a blackboard -based system
that supports the concurrent development and dynamic revision
of integrated process-planning and production-scheduling solutions and the maintenance of multiple problem instances and
solutions, as well as other flexible user-oriented decision-making
capabilities, allowing the user to control the scope of the problem and explore alternate tradeoffs (what-if scenarios) interactively. The system is scheduled for initial deployment
and evaluation in a large and highly dynamic machine shop at
Raytheon's Andover manufacturing facility.

Abstract
This paper explores the feasibility of using lottery scheduling, a proportional-share resource management algorithm,
to schedule processes under the FreeBSD operating system.
Proportional-share scheduling enables flexible control over
relative process execution rates and processor load insulation among groups of processes. We show that a straight implementation of lottery scheduling performs worse than the
standard FreeBSD scheduler. This initial result prompted
us to extend lottery scheduling. Except for one test we
run, our resulting system performs within one percent of
the FreeBSD scheduler. We describe our design, evaluate
our implementation, and relate our experience in deploying
our lottery scheduler on production machines.

Abstract
Instrumental (or operant) conditioning, a form of animal learning, is similar to reinforcement learning
(Watkins, 1989) in that it allows an agent to adapt its actions to gain maximally from the environment
while only being rewarded for correct performance. But animals learn much more complicated behaviors
through instrumental conditioning than robots presently acquire through reinforcement learning. We
describe a new computational model of the conditioning process that attempts to capture some of the
aspects that are missing from simple reinforcement learning: conditioned reinforcers, shifting reinforcement contingencies, explicit action sequencing, and state space refinement. We apply our model to a task
commonly used to study working memory in rats and monkeys: the DMTS (Delayed Match to Sample)
task. Animals learn this task in stages. In simulation, our model also acquires the task in stages, in a
similar manner. We have used the model to train an RWI B21 robot.

Abstract
When documents are organized in a large
number of topic categories, the categories
are often arranged in a hierarchy. The U.S.
patent database and Yahoo are two examples.
This paper shows that the accuracy of a naive
Bayes text classifier can be significantly improved by taking advantage of a hierarchy of
classes. We adopt an established statistical
technique called shrinkage that smoothes parameter estimates of a data-sparse child with
its parent in order to obtain more robust parameter estimates. The approach is also employed in deleted interpolation, a technique
for smoothing n-grams in language modeling
for speech recognition.
Our method scales well to large data sets,
with numerous categories in large hierarchies.
Experimental results on three real-world data
sets from UseNet, Yahoo, and corporate web
pages show improved performance, with a reduction in error up to 29% over the tradi
tional flat classifier.

ABSTRACT: Functions of time are often used to represent continuous parameters and the passage
of musical time (tempo). A new approach generalizes previous work in three ways. First, common
temporal operations of stretching and shifting are special cases of a new general time-warping
operation. Second, these operations are ``abstract.'' Instead of operating directly on signals or
events, they operate on abstract behaviors that interpret the operations at an appropriate structural
level. Third, time warping can be applied to both discrete events and continuous signals.

ABSTRACT
Digital interactive media augments interactive computing with video, audio, computer graphics and text,
allowing multimedia presentations to be individually and dynamically tailored to the user. Multimedia, and
particularly continuous media pose interesting problems for system designers, including those of latency
and synchronization. These problems are especially evident when multimedia data is remote and must be
accessed via networks. Latency and synchronization issues are discussed, and an integrated system,
Tactus, is described. Tactus facilitates the implementation of interactive multimedia computer programs by
managing latency and synchronization in the framework of an object-oriented graphical user interface
toolkit.

Abstract
Memory latency is an important bottleneck in system performance
that cannot be adequately solved by hardware alone. Several promising software techniques have been shown to address this problem
successfully in specific situations. However, the generality of these
software approaches has been limited because current architectures
do not provide a fine-grained, low-overhead mechanism for
observing and reacting to memory behavior directly. To fill this
need, we propose a new class of memory operations called informing memory operations, which essentially consist of a memory
operation combined (either implicitly or explicitly) with a conditional branch-and-link operation that is taken only if the reference
suffers a cache miss. We describe two different implementations of
informing memory operationsone based on a cache-outcome
condition code and another based on low-overhead trapsand find
that modern in-order-issue and out-of-order-issue superscalar processors already contain the bulk of the necessary hardware support.
We describe how a number of software-based memory optimizations can exploit informing memory operations to enhance performance, and look at cache coherence with fine-grained access
control as a case study. Our performance results demonstrate that
the runtime overhead of invoking the informing mechanism on the
Alpha 21164 and MIPS R10000 processors is generally small
enough to provide considerable exibility to hardware and software designers, and that the cache coherence application has
improved performance compared to other current solutions. We
believe that the inclusion of informing memory operations in
future processors may spur even more innovative performance
optimizations.

Abstract
We argue that discourse plans must capture the intended causal and decompositional relations between communicative actions. We present a planning algorithm, DPOCL, that builds plan structures that properly capture these relations, and show
how these structures are used to solve the problems that plagued previous discourse planners, and allow a system to participate
effectively and flexibly in an ongoing dialogue.

//abstract
Abstract
This paper describes an algorithm for simulating soft shadows at interactive rates using graphics hardware. On current graphics
workstations, the technique can calculate the soft shadows cast by moving, complex objects onto multiple planar surfaces in
about a second. In a static, diffuse scene, these high quality shadows can then be displayed at 30 Hz, independent of the number
and size of the light sources.
For a diffuse scene, the method precomputes a radiance texture that captures the shadows and other brightness variations on
each polygon. The texture for each polygon is computed by creating registered projections of the scene onto the polygon from
multiple sample points on each light source, and averaging the resulting hard shadow images to compute a soft shadow image.
After this precomputation, soft shadows in a static scene can be displayed in real-time with simple texture mapping of the
radiance textures. All pixel operations employed by the algorithm are supported in hardware by existing graphics workstations.
The technique can be generalized for the simulation of shadows on specular surfaces.

NIFDY: A Low Overhead, High Throughput Network Interface

//abstract
Abstract
In this paper we present NIFDY, a network interface that uses admission control to reduce congestion and ensures that packets are
received by a processor in the order in which they were sent, even
if the underlying network delivers the packets out of order. The
basic idea behind NIFDY is that each processor is allowed to have at
most one outstanding packet to any other processor unless the destination processor has granted the sender the right to send multiple
unacknowledged packets. Further, there is a low upper limit on the
number of outstanding packets to all processors.
We present results from simulations of a variety of networks
(meshes, tori, butterflies, and fat trees) and traffic patterns to verify NIFDY's efficacy. Our simulations show that NIFDY increases
throughput and decreases overhead. The utility of NIFDY increases
as a network's bisection bandwidth decreases. When combined
with the increased payload allowed by in-order delivery NIFDY increases total bandwidth delivered for all networks. The resources
needed to implement NIFDY are small and constant with respect to
network size.

Implementing Bit-addressing with Specialization

//abstract
Abstract
General media-processing programs are easily expressed with bit-addressing and variable-sized bit-fields. But the natural implementation of bit-addressing relies on dynamic shift offsets and repeated
loads, resulting in slow execution. If the code is specialized to the
alignment of the data against word boundaries, the offsets become
static and many repeated loads can be removed. We show how introducing modular arithmetic into an automatic compiler generator
enables the transformation of a program that uses bit-addressing
into a synthesizer of fast specialized programs.
In partial-evaluation jargon we say: modular arithmetic is supported by extending the binding time lattice used by the static analysis in a polyvariant compiler generator. The new binding time
Cyclic functions like a partially static integer.
A software cache combined with a fast, optimistic sharing analysis built into the compilers eliminates repeated loads and stores.
The utility of the transformation is demonstrated with a collection
of examples and benchmark data. The examples include vector
arithmetic, audio synthesis, image processing, and a base-64 codec.

//abstract
Abstract
Inversion of multilayer synchronous networks is a method which tries to answer questions
like "What kind of input will give a desired output?" or "Is it possible to get a desired
output (under special input/output constraints)?".
We will describe two methods of inverting a connectionist network. Firstly, we extend
inversion via backpropagation (Linden/Kindermann [4], Williams [11]) to recurrent (El-man [1], Jordan [3], Mozer [5], Williams/Zipser [10]), time-delayed (Waibel at al. [9])
and discrete versions of continuous networks (Pineda [7], Pearlmutter [6]). The result
of inversion is an input vector. The corresponding output vector is equal to the target
vector except a small remainder. The knowledge of those attractors may help to understand the function and the generalization qualities of connectionist systems of this
kind.
Secondly, we introduce a new inversion method for proving the non-existence of an
input combination under special constraints, e.g. in a subspace of the input space. This
method works by iterative exclusion of invalid activation values. It might be a helpful
way to judge the properties of a trained network.
We conclude with simulation results of three different tasks: XOR, morse signal decoding
and handwritten digit recognition.

Abstract
We describe our impressions of the SUPRENUM project and of its primary
supercomputer result, the Suprenum-1 prototype. We comment on the significance
of the architecture, its role among contemporary systems and its relevance to
current systems. We similarly discuss the SUPRENUM software and its impact on
distributed systems. Finally we discuss the successes and failures observed
throughout this exciting project and relate these to the organizational decisions on
which SUPRENUM was based.
As an illustration of Suprenum-1 capabilities, we describe the
implementation of a fluid dynamical benchmark on the 256 node Suprenum-1
parallel computer. The benchmark, the Shallow Water Equations, is frequently used
as a model for both oceanographic and atmospheric circulation. We describe the
steps involved in implementing the algorithm on the Suprenum-1 and we provide
details of performance obtained. For such regular grid-based algorithms the system
delivers a very impressive fraction (25%) of its theoretical peak rate of 5 Gflops.

Abstract
Sybil is a database integration and evolution environment for supporting large, heterogeneous applications.
We are interested in using Sybil to support the data integration and evolution needs of applications that are using legacy databases and are looking to integrate with
more modern database systems. The Sybil approach is
based on loosely coupling databases or other persistent
tools into lightweight alliances tailored for specific applications. Such alliances are built via four sorts of constructs: heterogeneous views, inter-database constraints,
inter-database propagations, and integration supported
by domain specific information.

Abstract
Recent work in feature-based classification has focused on non-parametric techniques that can classify instances even when the underlying feature distributions are
unknown. The inference algorithms for training these techniques, however, are designed
to maximize the accuracy of the classifier, with all errors weighted equally. In many
applications, certain errors are far more costly than others, and the need arises for
non-parametric classification techniques that can be trained to optimize task-specific
cost functions. This paper reviews the Linear Machine Decision Tree (LMDT) algorithm for inducing multivariate decision trees, and shows how LMDT can be altered to
induce decision trees that minimize arbitrary misclassification cost functions (MCFs).
Demonstrations of pixel classification in outdoor scenes show how MCFs can optimize
the performance of embedded classifiers within the context of larger image understand
ing systems.

Abstract
Neural networks are trained for balancing 1
and 2 poles attached to a cart on a fixed
track. For one variant of the single pole system, only pole angle and cart position variables are supplied as inputs; the network
must learn to compute velocities. All of the
problems are solved using a fixed architecture
and using a new version of cellular encoding that evolves an application specific architecture with real-valued weights. The learning times and generalization capabilities are
compared for neural networks developed using both methods. After a post processing
simplification, topologies produced by cellular encoding were very simple and could be
analyzed. Architectures with no hidden units
were produced for the single pole and the two
pole problem when velocity information is
supplied as an input. Moreover, these linear
solutions display good generalization. For all
the control problems, cellular encoding can
automatically generate architectures whose
complexity and structure reflect the features
of the problem to solve.

Abstract
Template matching is an effective means of locating vehicles in outdoor scenes, but it tends to be
a computationally expensive. To reduce processing time, we use large neural networks to predict, or
index, a small subset of templates that are likely to match each window in an image. Results on actual
LADAR range images show that limiting the templates to those selected by the neural networks reduces
the computation time by a factor of 5 without sacrificing the accuracy of the results.

Abstract
We have studied the performance of a high-speed
commercial spread-spectrum wireless LAN that uses the
CSMA/CA multiple-access strategy. Employing synthetic workloads, we measured packet capture success
more so than signal propagation characteristics. Specifically, we measured throughput, packet loss rates, range,
and patterns of errors within packets. We conclude
that CSMA/CA is quite successful in allocating bandwidth under stress, but that packet capture rate degrades very quickly once the LAN's effective range is
exceeded. Hence, network maintainers should plan the
layout of wireless networks at least as carefully as they
plan wired networks.

//abstract
Abstract
In this paper, we present new algorithms to balance
the computation of parallel hash joins over heterogeneous processors in the presence of data skew and external loads. Heterogeneity in our model consists of
disparate computing elements, as well as general purpose computing ensembles that are subject to external loading (e.g., a LAN connected workstation cluster). Data skew manifests itself as significant non-uniformities in the distribution of attribute values of
underlying relations that are involved in a join.
We develop cost models and predictive dynamic
load balancing protocols to detect imbalance during
the computation of a single large join. New predictive bucket scheduling algorithms are presented that
smooth out the load over the entire ensemble by reallocating buckets whenever imbalance is detected. Our
algorithms can account for imbalance due to data skew
as well as heterogeneity in the computing environment.
Significant performance gains are reported for a wide
range of test cases on a prototype implementation of
the system.

Abstract
In this paper we discuss a data mining framework for constructing intrusion detection models.
The key ideas are to mine system audit data for consistent and useful patterns of program and
user behavior, and use the set of relevant system features presented in the patterns to compute
(inductively learned) classifiers that can recognize anomalies and known intrusions. Our past experiments showed that classifiers can be used to detect intrusions, provided that sufficient audit
data is available for training and the right set of system features are selected. We propose to use
the association rules and frequent episodes computed from audit data as the basis for guiding the
audit data gathering and feature selection processes. We modify these two basic algorithms to use
axis attribute(s) as a form of item constraints to compute only the relevant (useful) patterns, and
an iterative level-wise approximate mining procedure to uncover the low frequency (but important)
patterns. We report our experiments in using these algorithms on real-world audit data.

//abstract
Abstract. This paper presents Kenmore, a general framework for knowledge acquisition for natural language processing (NLP) systems. To ease
the acquisition of knowledge in new domains, Kenmore exploits an online corpus using robust sentence analysis and embedded symbolic machine learning techniques while requiring only minimal human intervention. By treating all problems in ambiguity resolution as classification
tasks, the framework uniformly addresses a range of subproblems in sentence analysis, each of which traditionally had required a separate computational mechanism. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the
successful use of Kenmore for learning solutions to several problems in
lexical and structural ambiguity resolution. We argue that the learning
and knowledge acquisition components should be embedded components
of the NLP system in that (1) learning should take place within the
larger natural language understanding system as it processes text, and
(2) the learning components should be evaluated in the context of prac
tical language-processing tasks.

Abstract
Many high-level language compilers generate C code and
then invoke a C compiler for code generation. To date, most
of these compilers link the resulting code against a conservative mark-sweep garbage collector in order to reclaim unused
memory. We introduce a new collector, MCC, based on an
extension of mostly-copying collection.
We analyze the various design decisions made in MCC
and provide a performance comparison to the most widely
used conservative mark-sweep collector (the Boehm-Demers-Weiser collector). Our results show that a good mostly-copying collector can outperform a mature highly-optimized
mark-sweep collector when physical memory is large relative
to the live data. A surprising result of our analysis is that
cache behavior can have a greater impact on overall performance than either collector time, or allocation code.

On-Line Search in a Simple Polygon
//author
Jon M. Kleinberg
//abstract
Abstract
We consider a number of search and exploration problems, from the perspective of
robot navigation in a simple polygon. These problems are "on-line" in the sense that
the robot does not have access to the map of the polygon; it must make decisions as it
proceeds, based only on what it has seen so far. For the problem of exploring a simple
rectilinear polygon (under the L 1 norm), Deng, Kameda, and Papadimitriou give a
2-competitive deterministic algorithm; we present a randomized exploration algorithm
which is 5=4-competitive. Using similar techniques, we are able to give an algorithm
for searching an arbitrary, unknown rectilinear polygon. No constant competitive ratio
is attainable in this case, but our algorithm is within a constant factor of optimal in
the worst case; in a sense, it is a generalization of some of the strategies of Baeza-Yates, Culberson, and Rawlins to a much more general class of search spaces. Finally,
we examine a type of polygon for which competitive search is possible | the class of
"streets" considered by Klein, who gave a 1 + 3
2 -competitive algorithm for the search
problem in this case. We present a simple algorithm with a competitive ratio of at
most
q
p
8 (~ 2:61); in rectilinear streets it achieves the optimal competitive ratio
of
2.

We consider the problem of planning sensor control strategies that enable a

robust and efficient algorithms for computing the regions from which a sensor
has unobstructed or partially obstructed views of a target in a goal. We apply
these algorithms to the Error Detection and Recovery problem of recognizing
whether a goal or failure region has been achieved. Based on these methods and
strategies for visually-cued camera control, we have built a robot surveillance
system in which one mobile robot navigates to a viewing position from which
it has an unobstructed view of a goal region, and then uses visual recognition
to detect when a specific target has entered the region.

Abstract
Recently, several new algorithms have been developed for the minimum cut problem.
These algorithms are very different from the earlier ones and from each other and substantially improve worst-case time bounds for the problem. We conduct experimental evaluation
the relative performance of these algorithms. In the process, we develop heuristics and data
structures that substantially improve practical performance of the algorithms. We also develop problem families for testing minimum cut algorithms. Our work leads to a better
understanding of practical performance of the minimum cut algorithms and produces very
efficient codes for the problem.

Performing Out-of-Core FFTs on Parallel Disk Systems

//abstract
Abstract
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) plays a key role in many areas of computational science
and engineering. Although most one-dimensional FFT problems can be entirely solved entirely in
main memory, some important classes of applications require out-of-core techniques. For these,
use of parallel I/O systems can improve performance considerably. This paper shows how to
perform one-dimensional FFTs using a parallel disk system with independent disk accesses. We
present both analytical and experimental results for performing out-of-core FFTs in two ways:
using traditional virtual memory with demand paging, and using a provably asymptotically
optimal algorithm for the Parallel Disk Model (PDM) of Vitter and Shriver. When run on a
DEC 2100 server with a large memory and eight parallel disks, the optimal algorithm for the
PDM runs up to 144.7 times faster than in-core methods under demand paging. Moreover, even
including I/O costs, the normalized times for the optimal PDM algorithm are competitive, or
better than, those for in-core methods even when they run entirely in memory.

Abstract
Agent Tcl is a transportable agent system. The agents are written in an extended version of the
Tool Command Lanuage (Tcl). Each agent can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point, transport
to another machine and resume execution on the new machine. This migration is accomplished with
the agent jump command. agent jump captures the current state of the Tcl script and transfers this
state to the destination machine. The state is restored on the new machine and the Tcl script continues
its execution from the command immediately after the agent jump. In addition to migration, agents
can send messages to each other and can establish direct connections. A direct connection is more
efficient than message passing for bulk data transfer. Finally, agents can use the Tk toolkit to create
graphical user interfaces on their current machine. Agent Tcl is implemented as two components. The
first component is an extended Tcl interpreter. The second component is a server which runs on each
machine. The server accepts incoming agents, messages and connection requests and keeps track of the
agents that are running on its machine. An alpha release of Agent Tcl is available for public use. This
documentation describes how to obtain and compile the source code, how to run the server and how to
write transportable agents.

Abstract
Given a set of n points, what is the description complexity of their convex hull? In our world, this question
is understood with an implicit "in the worst case", and the answer is n bd=2c where d is the dimension of
the underlying space. This is not entirely satisfactory, as this description complexity can vary tremendously
depending on the positions of the points. Another approach is to look at the expected description complexity
when the points are drawn from a given distribution. This type of analysis, initiated by Renyi and Sulanke
[RS63] and pursued by others gets its value from the fact that this expectation is in general much smaller
than in the worst case, and, more importantly, in that it often allows one to design algorithms that have
expected running times against which worst case aware algorithms cannot compete. For instance, the convex
hull of n points drawn independently uniformly at random from a d-dimensional hypercube has expected
complexity O(log d1 n), and can be computed in expected linear time.
In parallel, in the past decade, a number of papers have considered a setting where points are allowed
to move along low degree algebraic trajectories. Different questions have been asked in this context. In
particular, Atallah [Ata85], studied the number of times the combinatorial description of the convex hull
or closest pair can change, in the worst case ("dynamic computational geometry"). More recently, Basch,
Guibas, and Hershberger [BGH97] have designed kinetic data structures to maintain these attributes in an
online setting, measuring the quality of a kinetic data structure by the ratio of the worst case number of
changes to the configuration of interest, to the worst case number of changes to the data structure itself, for
low degree algebraic motions. However, an experimental study undertaken in [BGSZ97] to assess the quality
of these data structures in practice shows that the worst case analysis can hide vastly different results in
terms of expectation when the point positions and speeds are drawn at random from some distributions. It
is this study that motivated the present paper.
In this communication, we report several results on the expected number of changes to various combinatorial structures for the case when points are drawn from the uniform distribution on the unit square. These
results can be generalized for any dimension d &gt; 2.

Abstract
The geometric point set matching problem in 2 and 3 dimensions is a well-studied problem with application to areas such as computer vision and pattern recognition, computational chemistry and other fields
such as cartography and computer animation. The basic problems can be formulated as follows. Given
some choice of a space of transformations and a similarity measure d(P; Q) for two point sets P and Q in
Euclidean space.
Problem 1 (Pattern Matching (PM)) Given point sets P and Q, where jP j = k and jQj = n with
k n, and an * &gt; 0, find a transformation T for which d(T (P ); Q) * or return none if no such T exists.
Problem 2 (Largest Common Point-set (LCP)) Given point sets P and Q, where jP j = m and jQj =
n, K &gt; 0 and * &gt; 0, find a transformation T and a set P 0 P of size jP 0 j K such that jd(T (P 0 ); Q)j *
or return none if no such T and P 0 exist.
We restrict T to the space of rigid Euclidean translations and rotations. The similarity measures of interest
to us are: the exact metric 1 d E (P; Q) (binary-valued, requiring each point in P to be mapped to a point in
Q); the Hausdorff metric d H (P; Q) (maximum over all points in P of the distance to the nearest point in
Q); and, the matching metric d M (bottleneck matching distance).
A detailed study of this set of problems was initiated by Alt, Mehlhorn, Wagener, and Welzl [AMWW88].
In this seminal work, they propose a suite of algorithms for the exact and matching metrics. More recent work
led to improved bounds for pattern matching and LCP under the exact metric. The problem of estimating
the minimum Hausdorff distance between two point sets in 2 and 3 dimensions has been studied extensively.
Clearly, any real application of such algorithms has to deal with the presence of noise in data, requiring
the algorithms to perform matching within the limits of some reasonable noise model. In fact, our interest
in these problems arose during an attempt to implement such algorithms for applications in computer vision
and in computational biology and chemistry, particularly rational drug design [FKL + 97]. We discovered that
noise present in real data rendered most known algorithms inoperative. In hindsight, this is not surprising
for, as noted in the survey by Alt and Guibas [AG96], these algorithms are likely to be "difficult to implement
and numerically unstable due to the necessary computation of intersections of complex algebraic surfaces."
Worse still, they have unacceptably high running times: for example, even in R 2 , LCP under the matching
metric requires O(n 8 ) time, although under additional restrictions on noise regions the running times can be

Abstract
Classification is a key function of many "business
intelligence" toolkits and a fundamental building block
in data mining. Immense data may be needed to train
a classifier for good accuracy. The state-of-art classifiers [21, 25] need an in-memory data structure of
size O(N ), where N is the size of the training data,
to achieve efficiency. For large data sets, such a data
structure will not fit in the internal memory. The best
previously known classifier does a quadratic number of
I/Os for large N .
In this paper, we propose a novel classification algorithm (classifier) called MIND (MINing in
Databases). MIND can be phrased in such a way that
its implementation is very easy using the extended relational calculus SQL, and this in turn allows the classifier to be built into a relational database system directly. MIND is truly scalable with respect to I/O efficiency, which is important since scalability is a key
requirement for any data mining algorithm.
We built a prototype of MIND in the relational
database manager DB2 and benchmarked its performance. We describe the working prototype and report
the measured performance with respect to the previous
method of choice. MIND scales not only with the size
of the datasets but also with the number of processors
on an IBM SP2 computer system. Even on uniproces-sors, MIND scales well beyond the dataset sizes previously published for classifiers. We also give some
insights that may have an impact on the evolution of
the extended relational calculus SQL.

Abstract
Reinforcement learning is the problem of generating optimal behavior in a sequential decision-making environment given the opportunity of
interacting with it. Many algorithms for solving reinforcement-learning
problems work by computing improved estimates of the optimal value
function. We extend prior analyses of reinforcement-learning algorithms
and present a powerful new theorem that can provide a unified analysis of
value-function-based reinforcement-learning algorithms. The usefulness
of the theorem lies in how it allows the asynchronous convergence of a
complex reinforcement-learning algorithm to be proven by verifying that
a simpler synchronous algorithm converges. We illustrate the application
of the theorem by analyzing the convergence of Q-learning, model-based
reinforcement learning, Q-learning with multi-state updates, Q-learning
for Markov games, and risk-sensitive reinforcement learning.

Representing Moving Images with Layers
//author
John Y. A. Wang AND Edward H. Adelson
//abstract
Abstract
We describe a system for representing moving
images with sets of overlapping layers. Each
layer contains an intensity map that defines the
additive values of each pixel, along with an alpha
map that serves as a mask indicating the transparency. The layers are ordered in depth and
they occlude each other in accord with the rules
of compositing. Velocity maps define how the
layers are to be warped over time. The layered
representation is more flexible than standard image transforms and can capture many important
properties of natural image sequences. We describe some methods for decomposing image sequences into layers using motion analysis, and we
discuss how the representation may be used for
image coding and other applications.

ABSTRACT
Research and development efforts in the parallel and
distributed simulation field over the last 15 years
has progressed, largely independently, in two separate camps: the largely academic high performance
Parallel And Distributed (discrete event) Simulation (PADS) community, and the DoD-centered Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) community.
This tutorial gives an overview and comparison of
work in these two areas, emphasizing issues related to
distributed execution where these fields have the most
overlap. Differences in the fundamental assumptions
routinely used within each community are contrasted,

Storage Systems for Movies-on-Demand Video Servers

1 Abstract
In this paper, we evaluate storage system alternatives for movies-on-demand video servers. We begin by
characterizing the movies-on-demand workload. Then we study disk farms in which one movie is stored per
disk. This is a simple scheme, but it wastes substantial disk bandwidth, since disks holding less popular
movies are under-utilized; also, good performance requires that movies be replicated to reflect the user
request pattern. Next, we examine disk farms in which movies are striped across disks, and find that
striped video servers offer close to full utilization of the disks by achieving better load balancing. Finally, we
evaluate the use of storage hierarchies for video service that include a tertiary library along with a disk farm.
Unfortunately, we show that the performance of neither magnetic tape libraries nor optical disk jukeboxes
as part of a storage hierarchy is adequate to service the predicted distribution of movie accesses. We suggest
changes to tertiary libraries that would make them better-suited to these applications.

Abstract| Generalized connectors provide the capability to connect a single input to one or more outputs. Such networks play an important role in supporting any application that involves the distribution of information from one source to many destinations or many sources to many destinations. We present the first analytic model for evaluating blocking probability in generalized connectors. The model allows flexibility in specifying traffic fanout characteristics and network routing algorithms. Equations are derived for computing blocking probability for the important class of series-parallel networks. We investigate the accuracy of the equations by comparing the blocking probability computed using the equations to results from simulation.

Abstract
We examine using a CASE tool, Interactive Development Environment's Software through Pictures (StP), to support reverse engineering. We generate structure charts in StP from the automated analysis
of C source code. The advantages of this approach are that one can use
the CASE tool's support for drawing, linking, and modifying pictorial
notations for program design in order to make it easier to construct a
reverse engineering tool. Additionally, one can then use the design rep
resentations with the CASE tool to do reengineering for maintenance.

Abstract
Association rules, introduced by Agrawal, Imielinski, and
Swami, are rules of the form "for 90 % of the rows of the
relation, if the row has value 1 in the columns in set W ,
then it has 1 also in column B". Efficient methods exist for
discovering association rules from large collections of data.
The number of discovered rules can, however, be so large
that browsing the rule set and finding interesting rules from
it can be quite difficult for the user. We show how a simple
formalism of rule templates makes it possible to easily describe the structure of interesting rules. We also give examples of visualization of rules, and show how a visualization
tool interfaces with rule templates.

Abstract
We describe a database system for writing, editing, and querying structured documents. The structure of text is described using a context-free
grammar. The operations are implemented using a powerful query language. The system supports the use of user-defined multiple views of the
documents: one view can contain all the structure explicitly, while another
can contain only part of the document and have only part of the structure visible. This makes the system flexible for different editing tasks.
The system is implemented in C using a relational database system.

Abstract. The core of multiple-view geometry is governed by the fundamental matrix and the trilinear
tensor. In this paper we unify both representations by first re-deriving the fundamental matrix as a rank
deficient tensor, and secondly by deriving a unified set of operators that are transparent to the number of
views. As a result, we show that the basic building block of the geometry of multiple views is the trilinear
tensor of three views and that this tensor specializes to the fundamental matrix (in it's tensor form) in
the case of two views. The properties of the tensor (geometric interpretation, contraction properties,
etc.) are independent of the number of views (two or three). As a byproduct, every two-view algorithm
can be considered as a degenerate three-view algorithm and three-view algorithms can work with either
two or three images, all using one standard set of tensor operations. To highlight the usefulness of this
paradigm we provide two practical applications. First we present a novel view synthesis algorithm that
starts with the fundamental matrix (in its tensor form) and seamlessly move to the general trilinear
tensor, all using one set of tensor operations. The second application is a camera stabilization algorithm,
originally introduced for three views, now working with two views without modification.

Coordination and Control Structures and Processes:
Possibilities for Connectionist Networks (CN)
//author

//abstract
Abstract
The absence of powerful control structures and processes that synchronize, coordinate, switch between, choose among, regulate, direct, modulate interactions between, and
combine distinct yet interdependent modules of large connectionist networks (CN) is
probably one of the most important reasons why such networks have not yet succeeded at
handling difficult tasks (e.g. complex object recognition and description, complex
problem-solving, planning).
In this paper we examine how CN built from large numbers of relatively simple
neuron-like units can be given the ability to handle problems that in typical multi-computer networks and artificial intelligence programs along with all other types of
programs are always handled using extremely elaborate and precisely worked out central control (coordination, synchronization, switching, etc.). We point out the several
mechanisms for central control of this un-brain-like sort that CN already have built into
them albeit in hidden, often overlooked, ways.
We examine the kinds of control mechanisms found in computers, programs, fetal
development, cellular function and the immune system, evolution, social organizations,
and especially brains, that might be of use in CN. Particularly intriguing suggestions are
found in the pacemakers, oscillators, and other local sources of the brain's complex partial synchronies; the diffuse, global effects of slow electrical waves and neurohormones;
the developmental program that guides fetal development; communication and coordination within and among living cells; the working of the immune system; the evolutionary
processes that operate on large populations of organisms; and the great variety of partially competing partially cooperating controls found in small groups, organizations, and
larger societies. All these systems are rich in control but typically control that emerges
from complex interactions of many local and diffuse sources. We explore how several
different kinds of plausible control mechanisms might be incorporated into CN, and
assess their potential benefits with respect to their cost.

Abstract: Practical pattern classification and knowledge discovery problems require selection of a
subset of attributes or features (from a much larger set) to represent the patterns to be classified.
This is due to the fact that the performance of the classifier (usually induced by some learning
algorithm) and the cost of classification are sensitive to the choice of the features used to construct
the classifier. Exhaustive evaluation of possible feature subsets is usually infeasible in practice because
of the large amount of computational effort required. Genetic algorithms, which belong to a class of
randomized heuristic search techniques, offer an attractive approach to find near-optimal solutions
to such optimization problems. This paper presents an approach to feature subset selection using a
genetic algorithm. Some advantages of this approach include the ability to accommodate multiple
criteria such as accuracy and cost of classification into the feature selection process and to find feature
subsets that perform well for particular choices of the inductive learning algorithm used to construct
the pattern classifier. Our experiments with several benchmark real-world pattern classification
problems demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to feature subset selection in the automated
design of neural networks for pattern classification and knowledge discovery.

Abstract
This paper describes a course in compiler design that focuses on the
Scheme implementation of a Scheme compiler that generates native assembly code for a real architecture. The course is suitable for advanced
undergraduate and beginning graduate students. It is intended both to
provide a general knowledge about compiler design and implementation
and to serve as a springboard to more advanced courses. Although this
paper concentrates on the implementation of a compiler, an outline for an
advanced topics course that builds upon the compiler is also presented.

Abstract
Standard methods for abductive understanding are neutral to prior experience and current goals.
Candidate explanations are built from scratch by backwards chaining, without considering how
similar situations were previously explained, and selection of the candidate to accept is based on its
likelihood, without considering the information needs beyond routine understanding. Problems arise
when applying these methods to everyday understanding: The vast range of possible explanations
makes it difficult to control the cost of explanation construction and to assure that the explanations
generated will actually be useful.
We argue that these problems can be overcome by using goals and experience to guide both
explanation generation and evaluation. Our work is within the framework of case-based explanation, which builds explanations by retrieving and adapting prior explanations stored in memory.
We substantiate our model by describing mechanisms that enable it to effectively generate good
explanations. First, we demonstrate that there exists a theory of anomaly and explanation that can
guide retrieval of relevant explanations. Second, we present a plausibility evaluation process that
efficiently detects conflicts and confirmations of an explanation's assumptions by prior patterns,
making it possible to focus explanation adaptation when retrieved explanations are implausible.
Third, we present methods for judging whether explanations provide the information needed to satisfy explainer goals beyond routine understanding. By reflecting experience and goals in the search
for explanations, case-based explanation provides a practical mechanism for guiding search towards
explanations that are both plausible and useful.

Abstract
The case-based reasoning process depends on
multiple overlapping knowledge sources, each
of which provides an opportunity for learning. Exploiting these opportunities requires
not only determining the learning mechanisms
to use for each individual knowledge source,
but also how the different learning mechanisms interact and their combined utility. This
paper presents a case study examining the
relative contributions and costs involved in
learning processes for three different knowledge sources|cases, case adaptation knowledge, and similarity information|in a case-based planner. It demonstrates the importance
of interactions between different learning processes and identifies a promising method for integrating multiple learning methods to improve
case-based reasoning.

ABSTRACT
We present a novel robust methodology for corresponding a dense set of points on an
object surface from photometric values, for 3-D stereo computation of depth. The methodology utilizes multiple stereo pairs of images, each stereo pair taken of exactly the same
scene but under different illumination. With just 2 stereo pairs of images taken respectively for 2 different illumination conditions, a stereo pair of ratio images can be produced; one for the ratio of left images, and one for the ratio of right images. We
demonstrate how the photometric ratios composing these images can be used for accurate
correspondence of object points. Object points having the same photometric ratio with
respect to 2 different illumination conditions comprise a well-defined equivalence class of
physical constraints defined by local surface orientation relative to illumination conditions. We formally show that for diffuse reection the photometric ratio is invariant to
varying camera characteristics, surface albedo, and viewpoint and that therefore the same
photometric ratio in both images of a stereo pair implies the same equivalence class of
physical constraints. Corresponding photometric ratios along epipolar lines in a stereo pair
of images under different illumination conditions is therefore a robust correspondence of
equivalent physical constraints, and determination of depth from stereo can be performed
without explicitly knowing what these physical constraints being corresponded actually
are. This implies a very practical shape-from-stereo methodology applicable to perspective views and not requiring any knowledge whatsoever of illumination conditions. This is
particularly practical for determination of 3-D shape on smooth featureless surfaces which
has previously been hard to perform using stereo. We demonstrate experimental 3-D shape
determination from a dense set of points using our stereo technique on smooth objects of
known ground truth shape that are accurate to well within 1% depth accuracy.

Best-Case Results for Nearest Neighbor
Learning

Steven Salzberg, Arthur Delcher, David Heath, and Simon Kasif
//abstract
Abstract| In this paper we propose a theoretical model
for analysis of classification methods, in which the teacher
knows the classification algorithm and chooses examples in
the best way possible. We apply this model using the nearest-neighbor learning algorithm, and develop upper and lower
bounds on sample complexity for several different concept
classes. For some concept classes, the sample complexity
turns out to be exponential even using this best-case model,
which implies that the concept class is inherently difficult
for the nearest-neighbor algorithm. We identify several geometric properties that make learning certain concepts relatively easy. Finally we discuss the relation of our work
to helpful teacher models, its application to decision-tree
learning algorithms, and some of its implications for current experimental work.

Abstract
This paper presents a deterministic sorting algorithm, called Sharesort, that sorts n
records on an n-processor hypercube, shu*e-exchange, or cube-connected cycles in
O(log n (log log n) 2 ) time in the worst case. The algorithm requires only a constant
amount of storage at each processor. The fastest previous deterministic algorithm for
this problem was Batcher's bitonic sort, which runs in O(log 2 n) time.

Abstract
A distinct advantage of symbolic learning
algorithms over artificial neural networks is
that typically the concept representations
they form are more easily understood by humans. One approach to understanding the
representations formed by neural networks is
to extract symbolic rules from trained networks. In this paper we describe and investigate an approach for extracting rules from
networks that uses (1) the NofM extraction algorithm, and (2) the network training
method of soft weight-sharing. Previously,
the NofM algorithm had been successfully
applied only to knowledge-based neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that
our extracted rules generalize better than
rules learned using the C4.5 system. In addition to being accurate, our extracted rules
are also reasonably comprehensible.

//abstract
We report on work done to develop a benchmark problem for genetic programming, both
as a difficult problem to test GP abilities and as a platform for tuning GP parameters.
This benchmark, the royal tree, is a function that accounts for tree shape as part of its
evaluation function, thus it controls for a parameter not often found in the GP literature.
It also is a progressive function, allowing the user to set the difficulty of the problem
attempted. We not only describe the function, but also report on results of using island
parallelism for solving GP problems. The results obtained are somewhat surprising, as it
appears that a single large population outperforms a group of smaller populations under
all the conditions tested.

Abstract
A novel approach to learning first order logic formulae from positive and negative examples is incorporated in a system named ICL (Inductive Constraint
Logic). In ICL, examples are viewed as interpretations which are true or false
for the target theory, whereas in present inductive logic programming systems,
examples are true and false ground facts (or clauses). Furthermore, ICL uses a
clausal representation, which corresponds to a conjunctive normal form where
each conjunct forms a constraint on positive examples, whereas classical learning
techniques have concentrated on concept representations in disjunctive normal
form.
We present some experiments with this new system on the mutagenesis problem. These experiments illustrate some of the differences with other systems,
and indicate that our approach should work at least as well as the more classical
approaches.

Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, followed by automated segmentation of the corpus callosum
(CC) in midsagittal sections have important applications
in both clinical neurology and neurocognitive research
since the size and shape of the CC are shown to be correlated to sex, age, neurodegenerative diseases and various lateralized behavior in man. Moreover, whole head,
multispectral 3D MRI recordings enable voxel-based tissue classification and estimation of total brain volumes,
in addition to CC morphometric parameters. We propose
a new algorithm that uses both multispectral MRI measurements (intensity values) and prior information about
shape (CC template) to segment CC in midsagittal slices
with very little user interaction. The algorithm has been
tested on a sample of 10 subjects scanned with multispec-tral 3D MRI, collected for a study of dyslexia, with very
good agreement between the manually traced (true) CC
outline and the detected CC outline. We conclude that
the proposed method for CC segmentation is promising for
clinical use when multispectral MR images are recorded.

Abstract
This paper presents a study of the statistical characteristics and multiplexing of Variable-Bit-Rate (VBR)
MPEG-coded video streams. Our results are based on
23 minutes of video obtained from the entertainment
movie, The Wizard of Oz. The experimental setup
which was used to capture, digitize, and compress the
video stream is described. Although the study is conducted at the frame level (as opposed to the slice level),
it is observed that the inter-frame correlation structure for the frame-size sequence involves complicated
forms of pseudo-periodicity that are mainly affected
by the compression pattern of the sequence. A simple model for an MPEG traffic source is developed in
which frames are generated according to the compression pattern of the original captured video stream. The
number of cells per frame is fitted by a lognormal distribution. Simulations are used to study the performance of an ATM multiplexer for MPEG streams.

//abstract
Abstract
Since the late eighties, much progress has been made in the theory of termination analysis for
logic programs. However, from a practical point of view, the significance of much of the work
on termination is hard to judge, since experimental evaluations rarely get published. Here we
describe and evaluate a termination analyzer for Mercury, a strongly typed and moded logic-
functional programming language. Mercury's high degree of referential transparency and the
guaranteed availability of reliable mode information simplify the termination analysis of Mer-
cury compared with that of other logic programming languages. We describe our termination
analyzer, which uses a variant of a method developed by Plumer. It deals with full Mercury,
including modules, declarative input/output, the foreign language interface, and higher-order
features. In spite of these obstacles, it produces high-quality termination information, comparable to the results recently obtained by Lindenstrauss and Sagiv. Most important, in stark
contrast with Lindenstrauss and Sagiv's experimental results, our analyzer has a negligible
impact on the running time of the compiler of which it is part, even for large programs. This
means that the Mercury compiler can produce valuable termination information at no real
cost to the programmer.

Abstract
In comparision with other games, particularly chess, the research in computer bridge is
immature, and the best bridge-playing programs are mediocre. We propose to study the
automation of the card-playing segment of bridge (omitting bidding), using a number of
different techniques. In this paper we first give an introduction to the state of computer
bridge. Next, we propose two possible architectures for solving double-dummy bridge
(i.e., a simplified bridge game with perfect information): The first is based on the
combination of And-OR search and heuristic evaluation. The second forms a global plan
by merging subplans for each individual suit. Next, to deal with uncertain information in
real bridge, we present a new mechanism that combines the concepts of both minimax
search and possible worlds. Finally we give a brief description of further work toward
automating card-playing in real bridge.

Abstract
Explanation-Based Reinforcement Learning
(EBRL) was introduced by Dietterich and
Flann as a way of combining the ability of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn optimal plans with the generalization ability
of Explanation-Based Learning (EBL) (Di-etterich & Flann, 1995). We extend this
work to domains where the agent must order and achieve a sequence of subgoals in
an optimal fashion. Hierarchical EBRL can
effectively learn optimal policies in some of
these sequential task domains even when the
subgoals weakly interact with each other.
We also show that when a planner that can
achieve the individual subgoals is available,
our method converges even faster.

//abstract
ABSTRACT
This paper describes and evaluates distributed
wavelength reservation protocols for all-optical WDM
networks. These protocols are essential for applying
WDM techniques to large scale all-optical networks.
The protocols ensure that the wavelengths on the links
along a path are reserved before communication takes
place. A message is transmitted using the reserved
wavelengths and remains in the optical domain utill
it reaches the destination. Based upon the timing at
which the reservation is performed, the protocols are
classified into two categories: forward reservation protocols and backward reservation protocols. Although
forward reservation protocols are simpler, our performance study shows that backward reservation protocols provide better performance.

Abstract
The distribution of resources among processors, memory and
caches is a crucial question faced by designers of large-scale
parallel machines. If a machine is to solve problems with a
certain data set size, should it be built with a large number of
processors each with a small amount of memory, or a smaller
number of processors each with a large amount of memory?
How much cache memory should be provided per processor for
cost-effectiveness? And how do these decisions change as larger
problems are run on larger machines?
In this paper, we explore the above questions based on the
characteristics of five important classes of large-scale parallel scientific applications. We first show that all the applications have a hierarchy of well-defined per-processor working
sets, whose size, performance impact and scaling characteristics
can help determine how large different levels of a multiprocessor's cache hierarchy should be. Then, we use these working sets together with certain other important characteristics of
the applications|such as communication to computation ratios,
concurrency, and load balancing behavior|to reflect upon the
broader question of the granularity of processing nodes in high-performance multiprocessors.
We find that very small caches whose sizes do not increase
with the problem or machine size are adequate for all but two of
the application classes. Even in the two exceptions, the working
sets scale quite slowly with problem size, and the cache sizes
needed for problems that will be run in the foreseeable future
are small. We also find that relatively fine-grained machines,
with large numbers of processors and quite small amounts of
memory per processor, are appropriate for all the applications.

Abstract
Recently, several theoretical models of parallel architectures have been proposed to replace the PRAM as the model
that is presented to an algorithm designer. A primary focus of
the new models is to include the cost of interprocessor communication, which is increasingly important in modern parallel
architectures. We argue that modeling the communication costs
in the architecture or system is only one part of the problem.
The other, and usually much more difficult, part is modeling
the communication properties of the algorithm itself, which
provides necessary inputs into the architectural model to determine overall complexity. In this context, we make three main
points in this paper: (i) It is incomplete to describe communication without regard to its relationship with replication. We
propose a description of the communication-replication relationship in terms of the working set hierarchy of an algorithm.
(ii) Both inherent communication and the communication-replication relationship can be very difficult to model in irregular, dynamic computations that are crucial in many real-world
applications. We present some examples that demonstrate this
difficulty. (iii) We believe that substantial leverage can be
obtained in this effort from the computer systems community,
which can provide a hierarchy of simulation and profiling
toolsfrom abstract to detailedtailored to the needs of the
algorithm designers. We propose an initial set of simulation
tools, and we discuss possible future refinements to this set.

Abstract
Shared Virtual Memory (SVM) provides an inexpensive way to support the popular shared address
space programming model on networks of workstations or personal computers. Despite recent advances
in SVM systems, their performance for all but coarse-grained or regular applications is not well understood.
Nor is there an understanding of whether and how
fine-grained, irregular programs should be written differently for SVM, with its large granularities of communication and coherence, than for the more familiar
hardware coherent at cache line granularity. In this
paper we try to understand the performance and programming issues for emerging, irregular applications
on SVM systems. We examine performance on both
an aggressive all-software system as well as one with a
little hardware support in the network interface. We
also present approaches to improve the performance
of irregular applications at both the programming and
the system level. As a result of our experiences, we
identify a set of guidelines and techniques that pertain
specifically to programming SVM systems, beyond the
guidelines commonly used for programming hardware-coherent systems as well. We also present a further
relaxation of the memory consistency model, called
scope consistency, which is particularly effective for
such applications.

This paper describes network services to support

coordinate execution, manage communication, offload processing, and provide persistent storage for
their clients. Using this design, it is possible to support real-time features, such as collision detection,
voice bridging, persistent updates, physical simulation, and autonomous agents, that would be difficult to implement for large virtual environments
with a peer-to-peer design. The paper includes a
description of services being implemented in RING,
a client-server system for interaction between many

Abstract
We simulate a multiagent market with production, consumption, and exchange
mediated by a sealed-bid double auction. Marked price bubbles and subsequent
crashes occur when value-based (fundamentals-driven) and trend-based traders are
both present, and the market equilibrium price is ramped up exogenously. Similarly,
negative price bubbles and recoveries occur when the equilibrium price is ramped
down. Because the simulated market is auction-mediated, we can observe the operations of traders during these events, and study the interactions that produce and
resolve bubbles. Some preliminary circuit-breaker experiments are described, in which
bubbles are interrupted during their formation.

Abstract: The paper reports on the application of genetic
algorithms, probabilistic search algorithms based on the
model of organic evolution, to NP-complete combinatorial
optimization problems. In particular, the subset sum, maximum cut, and minimum tardy task problems are considered.
Except for the fitness function, no problem-specific changes
of the genetic algorithm are required in order to achieve results of high quality even for the problem instances of size
100 used in the paper. For constrained problems, such as the
subset sum and the minimum tardy task, the constraints are
taken into account by incorporating a graded penalty term
into the fitness function. Even for large instances of these
highly multimodal optimization problems, an iterated application of the genetic algorithm is observed to find the global
optimum within a number of runs. As the genetic algorithm
samples only a tiny fraction of the search space, these results
are quite encouraging.

Abstract
The concept of the global information infrastructure and specifically that of the World
Wide Web (WWW) has led to users accessing data of different media including images
and video data over a wide area network. These data objects have sizes the order of
megabytes and communication time is very large. The data size can be reduced without
losing information by applying loss-inducing techniques and this will lead to reduction in
communication time. Several loss-inducing techniques have been developed and each image
is treated differently by each technique. In some cases an acceptable quality of the image
is obtained and in some cases it is not. In this paper we develop a color-based technique
to quantify the data loss when a loss-inducing technique is applied to an image. This will
result in estimating whether the resulting image is indistinguishable from the original with
respect to the human eye. We illustrate its use to classify images according to the loss they
can tolerate. This avoids redundant communication of a high quality image when a lower
quality image can satisfy the application resulting in the conservation and better usage
of network resources. We present the technique, the communication time saved, and an
experimental evaluation to prove the validity of the technique.

Abstract
This paper presents an adaptive protocol for packet-level forward error-correction in dynamic networks. The objective is to facilitate best-effort real-time applications whose timing
constraints rule out the use of retransmission-based ARQ schemes. The degree of redundancy
is adjusted as a function of network state, decreasing when the network is well-behaved and
increasing when it is not. The control problem is nontrivial due to the fact that increased redundancy, beyond a certain level, backfires resulting in self-induced congestion which impedes
the timely recovery of information at the receiver.
In the first part of the paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the control problem
associated with dynamic forward error-correction, concentrating on a particular protocol called
Adaptive Forward Error-Correction (AFEC). We show that instabilities can arise from two
distinct sources|desired operating point location and network delay|and we give solutions to
handle them. The first causal factor is intimately tied to optimality, making its achievement
potentially perilous in the context of QoS-greedy applications.
The second part of the paper presents simulation results that confirm the qualitative dynamics predicted by the analysis. We quantitatively estimate the redundancy-recovery rate function
which relates redundancy to the quality of service rendered at the receiver. We show under what
conditions the curve's shape is unimodal and to what degree. We compare the performance of
AFEC against a static FEC protocol in which the redundancy factor is fixed. We show that
AFEC exhibits superior performance when the network is subject to structural changes that
persist for nonnegligible durations. Under short-range dependent traffic conditions, AFEC is
able to closely match the performance of optimum static FEC but not exceed it.

1. ABSTRACT
Domain specific Problem Solving Environments (PSEs) are the key new ingredients that will aid in the widespread use of Computational Science & Engineering
(CS&E) systems. Each PSE consists of a well defined library that supports the
numerical and symbolic solution of certain mathematical model(s) characterizing a
specific discipline, together with an easy to use software environment. This environment should ideally interact with the user in a language "natural" to the associated
discipline, and provide a high level abstraction of the underlying, computationally
complex, model. However, it appears that almost all extant PSEs assume that
the user is familiar with the specific functionality/applicability of the PSE. Their
primary design objective is to support some form of high level programming with
predefined state-of-the-art algorithmic infrastructure. As the functionality of these
systems increases, the user is expected to make complex decisions in the parametric space of the algorithmic infrastructure supported by the PSE. In this paper
we describe a knowledge based system, PYTHIA, to automate this decision making process and aid in providing a high level abstraction to the user. Specifically,
PYTHIA addresses the problem of (parameter, algorithm) pair selection within a
scientific computing domain assuming some minimum user specified computational
objectives and some characteristics of the given problem. PYTHIA's framework
and methodology is general and applicable to any class of scientific problems and

Abstract
In the approximate pattern matching problem, the text area to be searched
for an occurrence of a pattern can be pruned by applying a filtration condition. A q-gram based filtration condition defines potential text areas in terms
of pattern q-grams, i.e., strings of length q. A text area will be checked by
an accurate method only if the set of the q-grams in the text area satisfies a
certain condition. One hopes that the filtration limits the number of checks
to a minimum, thus making the algorithm quite efficient. However, computer experiments show that the filtration method works fine for cases when
the allowed error level k is relatively small compared to the pattern length,
but loses its efficiency quite sharply with an increasing k. This is a phase
transition phenomenon that is quite often observed in nature. In this paper,
we present a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon which will excuse
us to introduce advanced mathematical analysis based on certain languages,
correlation polynomials, generating functions and complex analysis. It is our
view that nothing can be more exciting and rewarding than finding a theoretical justification for an abrupt manifestation of nature.

Abstract
As databases increasingly integrate non-textual information
it is becoming necessary to support efficient similarity searching in addition to range searching. Recently, declustering
techniques have been proposed for improving the performance of similarity searches through parallel I/O. In this
paper, we propose a new scheme which provides good declus-tering for similarity searching. In particular, it does global
declustering as opposed to local declustering, exploits the
availability of extra disks and does not limit the partitioning of the data space. Our technique is based upon the
Cyclic declustering schemes which were developed for range
and partial match queries. We establish, in general, that
Cyclic declustering techniques outperform previously proposed techniques.

A Coarse-Grained Parallel
QR-Factorization Algorithm for
Sparse Least Squares Problems
//author
Tz. Ostromsky P. C. Hansen Z. Zlatev
//abstract
Abstract
A sparse QR-factorization algorithm SPARQR for coarse-grained parallel
computations is described. The coefficient matrix, which is assumed to be
general sparse, is reordered in an attempt to bring as many zero elements in
the lower left corner as possible. The reordered matrix is then partitioned into
block rows, and Givens plane rotations are applied in each block-row. These are
independent tasks and can be done in parallel. Row and column permutations
are carried out within the diagonal blocks in an attempt to preserve better the
sparsity of the matrix.
The algorithm can be used for solving least squares problems either directly
or combined with an iterative method (preconditioned conjugate gradients are
used). Small non-zero elements can optionally be dropped in the latter case.
This leads to a better preservation of the sparsity and, therefore, to a faster
factorization. The price which has to be paid is some loss of accuracy. The
iterative method is used to regain the accuracy lost during the factorization.
Numerical results from several experiments with matrices from the well-known Harwell-Boeing collection as well as with some larger sparse matrices are
presented in this work. An SGI Power Challenge computer with 16 processors
has been used in the experiments.

Efficient Finite-State Approximation of Context
Free Grammars

//abstract
Abstract. This paper introduces a novel method for constructing finite-state machines recognising context free (CF)
grammars. The method utilizes the idea of a path through
a finite-state machine (FSM). Certain paths form the basis
for an unfolding process which is applied to the LR(0) characteristic finite-state machine (CFSM) corresponding to the
grammar. The next section discusses the approximation algorithm, including this unfolding process, in more detail, and
section 3 introduces the concept of an unfolding criterion.
Section 4 proves the soundness of the approximation method,
and its exactness to arbitrary, fixed recursive depths. Section
5 presents initial computational figures resulting from an implementation of the method. A variation of the method that
is more computationally feasible is discussed. The final section compares the method with existing research on finite-state approximation of CF grammars, and presents preliminary conclusions regarding the method.

Abstract
In this paper, we evaluate the use of software distributed
shared memory (DSM) on a message passing machine as
the target for a parallelizing compiler. We compare this approach to compiler-generated message passing, hand-coded
software DSM, and hand-coded message passing. For this
comparison, we use six applications: four that are regular
and two that are irregular.
Our results are gathered on an 8-node IBM SP/2 using the TreadMarks software DSM system. We use the APR
shared-memory (SPF) compiler to generate the shared memory programs, and the APR XHPF compiler to generate message passing programs. The hand-coded message passing
programs run with the IBM PVMe optimized message passing library. On the regular programs, both the compiler-generated and the hand-coded message passing outperform
the SPF/TreadMarks combination: the compiler-generated
message passing by 5.5% to 40%, and the hand-coded
message passing by 7.5% to 49%. On the irregular programs, the SPF/TreadMarks combination outperforms the
compiler-generated message passing by 38% and 89%, and
only slightly underperforms the hand-coded message passing, differing by 4.4% and 16%. We also identify the factors
that account for the performance differences, estimate their
relative importance, and describe methods to improve the
performance.

Abstract
We present an empirical study of the accuracy-cost tradeoffs of Anderson's method.
The various parameters that control the degree of approximation of the computational
elements and the separateness of interacting computational elements govern both the
arithmetic complexity and the accuracy of the method. Our experiment shows that for
a given error requirement, using a near-field containing only nearest neighbor boxes
and a hierarchy depth that minimizes the number of arithmetic operations minimizes
the total number of arithmetic operations.

Abstract: An ongoing research project involves the design and evaluation of a software system
for simulating parallel computers. A major goal in the development of this system was to avoid the
high overhead associated with the conventional instruction-level simulation of sequential
computers, but to retain the accuracy of that technique derived from its use of the execution of real
programs. The resulting system is program-driven, but the overhead is significantly reduced by
profiling the program to get timing estimates for its basic blocks, which are then used at run time to
generate process execution times dynamically while avoiding a detailed emulation of each
instruction's execution. A number of experiments dealing with message-passing computer
systems have been performed in order to determine the level of accuracy that can be expected from
its performance predictions and to measure its overhead.

Abstract
In this paper we describe a formal framework for the problem of mining association rules. The theoretical foundation is based on the field of formal concept analysis. A concept is composed of closed subsets of attributes (itemsets)
and objects (transactions). We show that all frequent itemsets are uniquely determined by the frequent concepts. We
further show how this lattice-theoretic framework can be used to find a small rule generating set, from which one can
infer all other association rules.

Abstract
We develop a mathematical model for the coating of ceramic fibers by chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) in cylindrical hot- or cold-walled reactors. The model couples the
Navier-Stokes equations for the mixture of a carrier gas and precursor species, an energy
equation for the gaseous mixture, a convection-diffusion system for the reacting precursor
species, a fiber coating model, and a fiber heat conduction equation. The system is heated
by a combination of conduction, convection, and radiation.
The partial differential system resulting from this model is solved by adaptive finite element software using automatic mesh refinement and coarsening on a quadtree-structured
mesh. The results of parameter studies indicate the effectiveness of using adaptive solution techniques with CVD applications and also suggest some guidance for improving
the process.

Abstract
An automated design methodology incorporating industry-standard Navier-Stokes
codes and a gradient-based optimizer has been developed. This system is used to redesign the well-known NASA P2 and P8 hypersonic inlets. First, the Navier-Stokes
simulations of the original P2 and P8 inlet designs are validated using numerical convergence studies and comparison with wind-tunnel experimental data for the original
inlets published by NASA in the early 1970s. Second, the P2 and P8 inlets are redesigned with the objective of canceling the cowl shock (and, in the case of the P8
inlet, the additional cowl-generated compression) at the centerbody by appropriate
contouring of the centerbody boundary. The original inlets were intended to achieve
these same objectives, but detailed experimental measurements indicated that a substantial reflected shock system was present. The choice of the objective function, which
is used to drive the optimization, has a significant impact on the final design. Several
different formulations for the objective function have been employed, and improvements of 60% to 90% in the objective function have been achieved. This automated
design system represents one of the first successful combinations of numerical optimization methods with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics simulation for high
speed inlets, and demonstrates a new area in which High Performance Computing may
have considerable impact on problems of military and industrial significance.

People display regularities in almost everything they do. This

We describe a simple predictive method with these characteristics and show its predictive accuracy on a large dataset of
UNIX commands to be at least as good as others that have
been considered, while using fewer computational and memory resources.

Abstract
Massive rule induction has recently emerged as one of the
powerful data mining techniques. The problem is known to
be exponential in the size of the attributes, and given its ever
increasing use, can greatly benefit from parallelization.
In this paper, we study cost-effective approaches to paral-lelize rule generation algorithms. In particular, we consider
the propositional rule generation algorithm of the Discovery
Board system, and present our design and implementation of
a parallel algorithm for the same task. We then present some
early performance results of our parallelization scheme on
hardware and software distributed shared memory multiprocessors.

Abstract
There is an emerging consensus that an explicit architectural model
would be invaluable for large evolving software systems, providing them
with a framework within which such a system can be reasoned about and
maintained. But the great promise of architectural models has not been
fulfilled so far, due to a gap between the model and the system it purports
to describe. It is our contention that this gap is best bridged if the model
is not just stated, but is enforced.
This gives rise to a concept enforced architectural model |or, a law |
which is explored in this paper. We argue that this model has two major beneficial consequences: First, by bridging the above mentioned gap
between an architectural model and the actual system, an enforced architectural model provides a truly reliable framework within which a system
can be reasoned about and maintained. Second, our model provides software developers with a carefully circumscribed flexibility in molding the
law of a project, during its evolutionary lifetime|while maintaining certain architectural principles as invariant of evolution.

Abstract
The Law of Demeter [4] is accepted as a useful design principle that
promotes tightly encapsulated classes and reduced coupling. Principles
like this are routinely adopted in real-life projects, however neither the
programming languages nor the existing environments provide enough
support for effective realization of these principles. It is our thesis
that broad structural principles should be formally specified, strictly
enforced, and relaxed whenever relaxation is in order. In this paper
we show how this can be done under our darwin-E environment using,
the Law of Demeter as an illustration.

Abstract
This paper describes DIDO, a system we have
developed to carry out exploratory learning of
unfamiliar domains without assistance from an
external teacher. The program incorporates novel
approaches to experience generation and representation
generation. The experience generator uses a heuristic
based on Shannon's uncertainty function to find
informative examples. The representation generator
makes conjectures on the basis of small amounts of
evidence and retracts them if they prove to be wrong
or useless. A number of experiments are described
which demonstrate that the system can distribute its
learning resources to steadily acquire a good
representation of the whole of a domain, and that the
system can readily acquire both disjunctive and
conjunctive concepts even in the presence of noise.

Abstract
Many important scientific problems can be formulated as systems of ordinary differential equations with two-point boundary value constraints (BVODE). Multiple shooting
is one of the most widely used numerical techniques for solving BVODE problems.
In this work, we present a new distributed parallel numerical algorithm for BVODEs
which is based on multiple shooting. We investigate the numerical stability of this
new distributed algorithm and identify difficulties that can arise. We propose a new
parallel iterative refinement scheme to cope with some specific numerical difficulties
identified in our investigation. Computational experience is presented to demonstrate
the potential effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract
We present new strategies for "probably approximately correct" (pac) learning that use
fewer training examples than previous approaches. The idea is to observe training examples one-at-a-time and decide "on-line" when to
return a hypothesis, rather than collect a large
fixed-size training sample. This yields sequential learning procedures that pac-learn by observing a small random number of examples.
We provide theoretical bounds on the expected
training sample size of our procedure | but establish its efficiency primarily by a series of experiments which show sequential learning actually uses many times fewer training examples in
practice. These results demonstrate that pac-learning can be far more efficiently achieved in
practice than previously thought.

Real-valued random hidden variables can be useful for modelling

Abstract
While the task of answering queries from an
arbitrary propositional theory is intractable in
general, it can typically be performed efficiently
if the theory is Horn. This suggests that it
may be more efficient to answer queries using a "Horn approximation"; i.e., a horn theory that is semantically similar to the original
theory. The utility of any such approximation
depends on how often it produces answers to
the queries that the system actually encounters;
we therefore seek an approximation whose expected "coverage" is maximal. Unfortunately,
there are several obstacles to achieving this goal
in practice: (i) The optimal approximation depends on the query distribution, which is typically not known a priori; (ii) identifying the optimal approximation is intractable, even given
the query distribution; and (iii) the optimal approximation might be too large to guarantee
tractable inference. This paper presents an approach that overcomes (or side-steps) each of
these obstacles. We define a learning process,
AdComp, that uses observed queries to estimate the query distribution "online", and then
uses these estimates to hill-climb, efficiently,
in the space of size-bounded Horn approximations, until reaching one that is, with provably
high probability, effectively at a local optimum.

Abstract
Coding segments are those sub-segments of the chromosome which contribute either positively or
negatively to the fitness evaluation of the chromosome. We extract coding segments from chromosomes
and we investigate the sharing of coding segments both inside and outside of the chromosome. We
find duplication of coding segments inside the chromosomes provides a back-up mechanism for the
search heuristics. We further find local search in a collective memory of coding segments outside of the
chromosome, collective adaptation, enables the search heuristic to represent partial solutions which are
larger than realistic chromosomes lengths and to express the solution outside of the chromosome.

Abstract. In many concurrent programming languages, concurrent programs are difficult to extend and modify: small changes in a concurrent
program may require re-implementations of a large number of its components. In this paper a novel concurrent program composition mechanism
is presented in which implementations of computations and synchronizations are completely separated. Separation of implementations facilitates
extensions and modifications of programs by allowing one to change implementations of both computations and synchronizations. The paper
also describes a concurrent programming model and a programming lan
guage that support the proposed approach.

A VARIABLE TIME STEP METHOD FOR AN AGE-DEPENDENT
POPULATION MODEL WITH NONLINEAR DIFFUSION
//author
BRUCE P. AYATI
//abstract
Abstract. We propose a method for solving a model of age-dependent population diusion
with random dispersal. This method, unlike previous methods, allows for variable time steps and
independent age and time discretizations. We use a moving age discretization that transforms the
problem to a system of parabolic equations. The system is then solved by backward dierences in
time and a Galerkin approximation in space; the equations that need to be solved at each step treat
each age group separately. A priori L 2 error estimates are obtained by an energy analysis. These
estimates are superconvergent in the age variable. We present a postprocessing technique which
capitalizes on the superconvergence.

Abstract. A new wave of data-intensive and knowledge-based applications|such as data
mining and decision support|require the introduction of complex application-specific aggregate functions. In this paper, we propose extensions for deductive database systems to
support these new applications. We develop constructs, formal semantics, and implementation techniques for user-defined aggregates, and describe their realization in an extended
LDL++ system recently built at UCLA. With these extensions, the system can support online aggregation, roll-ups for data cubing, temporal aggregates for time-series, iceberg queries,
and other recently proposed operators used in decision support and data mining procedures.
We then discuss the application of this technology to other DBMSs, and in particular to the
SQL3 specifications that support the notion of user-defined aggregates. We show that SQL3
suffers from limitations that severely restrict its use in new applications; thus we propose
simple extensions similar to those used for LDL++ to overcome such limitations.

Abstract
In the design of algorithms, the greedy paradigm provides a powerful tool for solving
efficiently classical computational problems, within the framework of procedural languages. However, expressing these algorithms within the declarative framework of logic-based languages has proved to be a difficult research challenge. In this paper, we extend the framework of Datalog-like languages to obtain simple declarative formulations
for such problems, and propose effective implementation techniques to ensure computational complexities comparable to those of procedural formulations. These advances are
achieved through the use of the choice construct, that has semantics reducible to that of
programs with negation under stable model semantics. Then we extend the fixpoint-based
semantics of choice programs with preference annotations to guide search strategies and
simple logic-based formulations of classical greedy algorithms.

Semantics-based Failure Recovery in Distributed Systems
with Optimistic Message Logging

//abstract
Abstract
Recovery from failures is important in distributed computing. A common technique to support
recovery is asynchronous checkpointing, coupled with optimistic message logging. These schemes have
low overheads during failure-free operations and can provide an acceptable degree of fault-tolerance.
Central to these protocols is the determination of a maximal consistent global state, which is recoverable.
Message semantics is not exploited in most existing recovery protocols to determine the recoverable state.
We propose to identify messages that are not influential in the computation through message semantics.
These messages can be logically removed from the computation without changing its meaning or result.
In this paper, we illustrate with examples how the removal of these messages improves the theoretical
maximal consistent global state. Taking semantics into account, recovery protocols are then developed
to realize the idea. The semantics in object-oriented databases is adapted to special processes acting as
servers for further improvements. This technique can also be applied to ensure a more timely commitment
for output in a distributed computation.

Abstract
Run-time compilation techniques have been shown effective
for automating the parallelization of loops with unstructured
indirect data accessing patterns. However, it is still an open
problem to efficiently parallelize sparse matrix factorizations
commonly used in iterative numerical problems. The difficulty is that a factorization process contains irregularly-interleaved communication and computation with varying
granularities and it is hard to obtain scalable performance
on distributed memory machines. In this paper, we present
an inspector/executor approach for parallelizing such applications by embodying automatic graph scheduling techniques to optimize interleaved communication and computation. We describe a run-time system called RAPID that
provides a set of library functions for specifying irregular
data objects and tasks that access these objects. The system
extracts a task dependence graph from data access patterns,
and executes tasks efficiently on a distributed memory machine. We discuss a set of optimization strategies used in
this system and demonstrate the application of this system
in parallelizing sparse Cholesky and LU factorizations.

Abstract
We propose a general framework for computing invariant features from images. The proposed
approach is based on a simple concept of basis expansion. It is widely applicable to many popular
basis representations, such as wavelets [4, 5, 24, 25], short-time Fourier analysis [15, 30], and
splines [2, 6, 33]. Exploiting formulations that use both global and local information about
shape and color, the new approach is neither strictly global nor local. It has the advantage of
tolerating a certain degree of occlusion (unlike global analysis) and does not require estimating
high-order derivatives in computing invariants (unlike local analysis), whence is more robust.
Furthermore, it enables a quasi-localized, hierarchical shape analysis which is not possible with
other known invariant techniques. Unlike most current research on image invariants which
concentrates on either geometry or illumination invariants, the proposed framework is very
general and produces invariants which are insensitive to rigid motion, general affine transform,
changes of parameterization and scene illumination, and perspective transform.

Abstract. Two operations commute if the result of their execution is independent of the order in which they execute. Commuting operations can be executed
concurrently provided they execute atomically on the objects they access. Statically
recognizing commuting operations is of great interest because they increase the amount
of concurrency a compiler can exploit. In this document we introduce commutativity
analysis anew technique for automatically parallelizing serial programs. We then
conduct a feasibility study of existing scientific applications as to the existence and
exploitability of commuting operations. We study the commuting operations present
in one such application the Barnes-Hut hierarchical N-body algorithm. We then
parallelize this application using knowledge of commuting operations and present performance results of the parallel code for a shared-memory multiprocessor.

Abstract
This paper describes a set of classes designed to
facilitate concurrent programming using the sequential object-oriented language EIFFEL. The design and
implementation presented here is the application of a
more general Concurrency Model we have built to introduce concurrency to sequential OOPLs. The model
views concurrency as a well-defined, inheritable property of objects specified in the class CONCURRENCY,
and provides a methodology using inheritance to write
concurrent object-orient applications. Key ideas involved in the methodology are: active objects, extensibility of protocols, synchronization programming,
data-driven synchronization with asynchronous message passing.
The novel feature of our work is in its describing
concurrency in the context of sequential programming
and using a object-oriented design methodology to describe and implement it.
We illustrate the usefulness and expressiveness of
the concurrency mechanism by presenting examples
and analyzing them. The ability to express powerful
synchronization constraints as reusable software components emerges as a strong point of our implementation.

Abstract
The Scintilla project at UCSB studies SCI-based cluster
computing. The Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) is a
recent communication standard for cluster interconnects.
We focus on non-coherent SCI, using our cluster setup
of SBus-based and PCI-based workstations connected via
Dolphin SCI adapters. Our motivation for choosing SCI as
network fabric is the very low latency and high bandwidth.
We study how to map a variety of programming models efficiently onto the SCI hardware, focusing on message
passing and global address space support, implementing
Active Messages and Split-C. We present implementation
trade-offs, present performance measurements and compare the PCI and SBus adapters.
We found that the user-level load/store programming interface of SCI is very convenient to use, achieves low latencies, and is fully virtualized, simultaneously supporting
multiple parallel programs and communication channels.
On the other hand, neither of the programming models
studied maps directly to SCI. Issues such as notification,
atomic operations, and virtual address space limitations
represent major implementation challenges, which we address with a combination of compiler and run-time support. Overall, we found the SCI network a good substrate
for high-performance cluster computing.

Abstract
Automatic scheduling for directed acyclic graphs (DAG) and its applications for coarse-grained irregular problems such as large n-body simulation have been studied in the literature.
However solving irregular problems with mixed granularities such as sparse matrix factorization
is challenging since it requires efficient run-time support to execute a DAG schedule. In this
paper, we investigate run-time optimization techniques for executing general asynchronous
DAG schedules on distributed memory machines. Our solution tightly integrates the run-time
scheme with a fast communication mechanism to eliminate unnecessary overhead in message
buffering and copying. We discuss a consistency model incorporating the above optimizations,
and taking advantage of task dependence properties to ensure the correctness of execution.
We demonstrate the applications of this scheme in sparse factorizations and triangular solver
for which actual speedups are hard to obtain. Our experiments on Meiko CS-2 show that the
automatically scheduled code has achieved scalable performance for these problems and the
run-time overhead is small compared to the total execution time.

Abstract
Papadimitriou introduced several classes of NP search problems based on combinatorial principles which guarantee the
existence of solutions to the problems. Many interesting
search problems not known to be solvable in polynomial
time are contained in these classes, and a number of them
are complete problems. We consider the question of the relative complexity of these search problem classes. We prove
several separations which show that in a generic relativized
world, the search classes are distinct and there is a standard
search problem in each of them that is not computation-ally equivalent to any decision problem. (Naturally, absolute separations would imply that P 6= NP.) Our separation
proofs have interesting combinatorial content and go to the
heart of the combinatorial principles on which the classes are
based. We derive one result via new lower bounds on the
degrees of polynomials asserted to exist by Hilbert's Null-stellensatz over finite fields.

Abstract
Fast networks have made it possible to coordinate distributed heterogeneous CPU,
memory and storage resources to provide a powerful platform for executing high-performance applications. However, the performance of parallel applications on such
systems is highly dependent on the mapping of application tasks to machines. In this
paper, we propose a mapping strategy for applications formed by multiple tasks targeted
to heterogeneous platforms. We first define a mapping model, the match-tree, which
reects the data movement and conversion costs of distributed algorithms and allows for
alternative implementations of individual tasks on different machines. We then define the
find-mapping and split-partition algorithms, based on the match-tree model, to
determine the best allocation of tasks to resources in heterogeneous systems. We
illustrate the use of these algorithms with a sample distributed application.

Abstract
Execution speed of programs on modern computer architectures is sensitive, by a factor of two or more, to the order in which instructions
are presented to the processor. To realize potential execution efficiency,
it is now customary for an optimizing compiler to employ a heuristic
algorithm for instruction scheduling. These algorithms are painstakingly
hand-crafted, which is expenseive and time-consuming. We show how
to cast the instruction scheduling problem as a learning task, so that one
obtains the heuristic scheduling algorithm automatically. Our focus is the
narrower problem of scheduling straight-line code, also known as a basic
block of instructions. Our empirical results show that just a few features
are adequate for quite good performance at this task for a real modern
processor, and that any of several supervised learning methods perform
nearly optimally with respect to the features used.

Abstract
Planning and learning at multiple levels of temporal abstraction is a key
problem for artificial intelligence. In this paper we summarize an approach to this problem based on the mathematical framework of Markov
decision processes and reinforcement learning. Current model-based reinforcement learning is based on one-step models that cannot represent
common-sense higher-level actions, such as going to lunch, grasping an
object, or flying to Denver. This paper generalizes prior work on temporally abstract models [Sutton, 1995] and extends it from the prediction
setting to include actions, control, and planning. We introduce a more
general form of temporally abstract model, the multi-time model, and establish its suitability for planning and learning by virtue of its relationship
to the Bellman equations. This paper summarizes the theoretical framework of multi-time models and illustrates their potential advantages in a
gridworld planning task.

Abstract
Several researchers have proposed modeling
temporally abstract actions in reinforcement
learning by the combination of a policy and a termination condition, which we refer to as an option. Value functions over options and models of
options can be learned using methods designed
for semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs).
However, all these methods require an option to
be executed to termination. In this paper we explore methods that learn about an option from
small fragments of experience consistent with
that option, even if the option itself is not executed. We call these methods intra-option learning methods because they learn from experience
within an option. Intra-option methods are sometimes much more efficient than SMDP methods because they can use off-policy temporal-difference mechanisms to learn simultaneously
about all the options consistent with an experience, not just the few that were actually executed. In this paper we present intra-option learning methods for learning value functions over options and for learning multi-time models of the
consequences of options. We present computational examples in which these new methods
learn much faster than SMDP methods and learn
effectively when SMDP methods cannot learn at
all. We also sketch a convergence proof for intra
option value learning.

Abstract
The increasing development of mobile networks
raises new security requirements and concerns. In addition to the basic need of authentication, confidentiality and key distribution services, a new problem involving privacy is the unauthorized tracking of users'
migration. In other words, accessing any information
related to the mobile user's location data without his
consent, is a serious violation of his privacy. Moreover, if no care is taken, the disclosure of the mobile
user real identity may appear during the authentication process. The basic solution to this problem is the
use of aliases which insure non-traceability by hiding
the user's real identity and also his relationship with
domain authorities. In this paper we provide a classification of the different degrees of non-traceability and
present a new efficient method for the computation of
aliases. This technique can be used during authentication of mobile users and thus avoids the drawbacks of
existing solutions such as GSM and CDPD.

Composite Model Checking with Type Specific
Symbolic Encodings

//abstract
Abstract
We present a new symbolic model checking technique, which analyzes temporal properties in multi-typed transition systems. Specifically, the method uses multiple type-specific data encodings to represent
system states, and it carries out fixpoint computations via the corresponding type-specific symbolic
operations. In essence, different symbolic encodings are unified into one composite model checker. Any
type-specific language can be included in this framework provided that the language is closed under
Boolean connectives, propositions can be checked for satisfiability, and relational images can be computed.
Our technique relies on conjunctive partitioning of transition relations of atomic events based on variable
types involved, which allows independent computation of one-step pre- and post-conditions for each
variable type.
In this paper we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a nontrivial data-transfer protocol,
which contains a mixture of integer and Boolean-valued variables. The protocol operates over an unreliable channel that can lose, duplicate or reorder messages. Moreover, the protocol's send and receive
window sizes are not specified in advance; rather, they are represented as symbolic constants. The resulting system was automatically verified using our composite model checking approach, in concert with
a conservative approximation technique.

Abstract
Unlike wired links, wireless network bandwidth is highly limited
and the channel usually suffers from frequent and bursty loss due
to its vulnerability to various kinds of interference. At the same
time, the traditional TCP with its congestion control is well known
for its poor performance over wireless links. This paper proposes
a new protocol that (1) replaces TCP/IP over the wireless link by
a simpler protocol with smaller headers, if the link is the last hop
along a data path, (2) shifts functions needed to communicate with
an Internet host using TCP/IP from the mobile host to the base
station, so that the distinct wireless link is hidden from the outside Internet, and (3) exploits link-layer acknowledgments and re-transmissions to quickly recover losses over the wireless link. Our
simulation results show a substantial performance improvement
achieved by the new protocol.

Abstract
Association Rule Mining algorithms operate
on a data matrix (e.g., customers fi products)
to derive association rules [2, 23]. We propose a new paradigm, namely, Ratio Rules,
which are quantifiable in that we can measure
the "goodness" of a set of discovered rules.
We propose to use the "guessing error" as a
measure of the "goodness", that is, the root-mean-square error of the reconstructed values
of the cells of the given matrix, when we pretend that they are unknown. Another contribution is a novel method to guess missing/hidden values from the Ratio Rules that
our method derives. For example, if somebody bought $10 of milk and $3 of bread, our
rules can "guess" the amount spent on, say,
butter. Thus, we can perform a variety of important tasks such as forecasting, answering
"what-if" scenarios, detecting outliers, and visualizing the data. Moreover, we show how to
compute Ratio Rules in a single pass over the
dataset with small memory requirements (a
few small matrices), in contrast to traditional
association rule mining methods that require
multiple passes and/or large memory. Experiments

Abstract
This paper describes Dynamic Abstraction Planning
(DAP), an abstraction planning technique that improves the efficiency of state-enumeration planners for
real-time embedded systems such as CIRCA. Abstraction is used to remove detail from the state representation, reducing both the size of the state space that
must be explored to produce a plan and the size of the
resulting plan. The intuition behind this approach is
simple: in some situations, certain world features are
important, while in other situations those same features are not important.
By automatically selecting the appropriate level of abstraction at each step during the planning process,
DAP can significantly reduce the size of the search

initial plans that preserve safety but might, on further
refinement, do a better job of goal achievement. DAP
can also terminate with an executable abstract plan,
which may be much smaller than the corresponding
plan expanded to precisely-defined states. Preliminary
results show dramatic improvements in planning speed
and scalability.

Abstract
Most case-based reasoning systems have used a
single "best" or "most similar" case as the basis
for a solution. For many problems, however,
there is no single exact solution. Rather, there
is a range of acceptable answers. We use cases
not only as a basis for a solution, but also to
indicate the boundaries within which a solution
can be found. We solve problems by choosing
some point within those boundaries.
In this paper, I discuss this use of cases with
illustrations from chiron, a system I have implemented in the domain of personal income
tax planning.

A Comparison of Content-Based Image/Video Retrieval
Systems

//abstract
Abstract
Recently, content-based retrieval of images and video has become a hot research area. The reason for this
is the need for effective and efficient techniques, that meet user requirements, to access large volumes of digital
images and video data. In [GR 95], previous approaches to content-based retrieval is said to have taken two
directions. In the first approach, image contents are modeled as a set of attributes extracted manually and
managed within the framework of conventional database-management systems. The second approach depends
on an integrated feature-extraction/object-recognition subsystem to overcome the limitations of attribute-based retrieval. However, it has been also stated that [GR 95] recent content-based image retrieval systems
recognized the need for synergy between these two approaches.
There has been numerous efforts to build content-based image retrieval systems. These include, Chabot
[OS 95], SCORE [ATY 95, ATY 96], CONIVAS [AD 96], Photobook [PPS 93], CANDID [KCH 95], JACOB
[ALDV 96, LA 96], VisualSEEk [SC 96] and QBIC [FSN+ 95]. In the first place, these systems differ in their
querying capabilities. Images could be retrieved through the use of color, texture, sketch, shape, volume,
spatial constraints, browsing, motion, text and domain concepts. Current approaches to content-based image
retrieval also differ in terms of image features extracted, their level of abstraction and the degree of domain
independence. In this paper, a comparative survey on these systems is conducted to figure out design tradeoffs
and different approaches to content-based image retrieval. Furthermore, a taxonomy of content-based retrieval
systems, as well as a generic architecture, is provided.

Abstract
Ad hoc querying is difficult on very large datasets, since it
is usually not possible to have the entire dataset on disk.
While compression can be used to decrease the size of the
dataset, compressed data is notoriously difficult to index
or access.
In this paper we consider a very large dataset comprising multiple distinct time sequences. Each point in the
sequence is a numerical value. We show how to compress
such a dataset into a format that supports ad hoc querying, provided that a small error can be tolerated when the
data is uncompressed. Experiments on large, real world
datasets (AT&T customer calling patterns) show that the
proposed method achieves an average of less than 5% error
in any data value after compressing to a mere 2.5% of the
original space (i.e., a 40:1 compression ratio), with these
numbers not very sensitive to dataset size. Experiments
on aggregate queries achieved a 0.5% reconstruction error
with a space requirement under 2%.

Abstract
All mechanical designs pass through a series of formal and informal redesign steps, involving the analysis of functionality, manufacturability, cost and other life-cycle factors. The
speed and efficacy of these steps has a major influence on the lead time of the product from
conceptualization to launching. In this paper we propose a methodology for automatically
generating redesign suggestions for reducing setup costs for machined parts.
Given an interpretation of the design as a collection of machinable features, our approach
is to generate alternate machining features by making geometric changes to the original
features, and add them to the feature set of the original part to create an extended feature
set. The designer may provide restrictions on the design indicating the type and extent of
modifications allowed on certain faces and volumes, in which case all redesign suggestions
generated by our approach honor those restrictions.
By taking combinations of features from the extended feature set generated above, we can
generate modified versions of the original design that still satisfy the designer's intent. By
considering precedence constraints and approach directions for the machining operations as
well as simple fixturability constraints, we can estimate the setup time that will be required
for each design. Any modified design whose setup time is less than that of the original
design can be presented to the designer as a possible way to modify the original design.

Abstract: A transport protocol that supports real-time communication of
audio/video frames across campus-area packet switched networks is presented.
It is a best effort protocol that attempts to ameliorate the effect of jitter, load
variation, and packet loss, to provide low latency, synchronized audio and video
communications. This goal is realized through four transport and display
mechanisms, and a real-time implementation of these mechanisms that
integrates operating system services ( e.g., scheduling and resource allocation,
and device management) with network communication services ( e.g., transport
protocols), and with application code ( e.g., display routines). The four
mechanisms are: a facility for varying the synchronization between audio and
video to achieve continuous audio in the face of jitter, a network congestion
monitoring mechanism that is used to control audio/video latency, a queueing
mechanism at the sender that is used to maximize frame throughput without
unnecessarily increasing latency, and a forward error correction mechanism for
transmitting audio frames multiple times to ameliorate the effects of packet loss
in the network. The effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated by
measuring the performance of the protocol when transmitting audio and video
across congested networks.

Abstract
VBR compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple-
time-scale bit rate variability. In this paper, we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a high speed
network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most
effectively toward reducing the variability of the transmitted bit
rate.
We present two basic results. First, we present an optimal
smoothing algorithm for achieving the greatest possible reduction
in rate variability when transmitting stored video to a client with
given buffer size. We provide a formal proof of optimality, and
demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on a set of long
MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact
of optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for video
transport, under two network service models: Deterministic Guar-
anteed service [1, 11] and Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) service [9, 8].
Under both models, we find the impact of optimal smoothing to be
dramatic.

Abstract
There is increasing demand to extend CORBA to support
applications with stringent real-time requirements. However, conventional CORBA Object Request Brokers (ORBs)
exhibit substantial priority inversion and non-determinism,
which makes them unsuitable for applications with deterministic real-time requirements. This paper focuses on software
architectures that help to alleviate priority inversion and non-determinism in real-time CORBA ORBs. It also illustrates empirically why conventional ORBs do not yet support real-time
quality of service.

Abstract
We have developed compiler algorithms that analyze explicitly parallel programs and restructure their shared data to
reduce the number of false sharing misses. The algorithms
analyze per-process shared data accesses, pinpoint the data
structures that are susceptible to false sharing and choose
an appropriate transformation to reduce it. The transformations either group data that is accessed by the same processor or separate individual data items that are shared.
This paper evaluates that technique. We show through
simulation that our analysis successfully identifies the data
structures that are responsible for most false sharing misses,
and then transforms them without unduly decreasing spatial
locality. The reduction in false sharing positively impacts
both execution time and program scalability when executed
on a KSR2. Both factors combine to increase the maximum
achievable speedup for all programs, more than doubling
it for several. Despite being able to only approximate actual inter-processor memory accesses, the compiler-directed
transformations always outperform programmer efforts to
eliminate false sharing.

Abstract
Real-time continuous media traffic, such as digital video and audio, is expected
to comprise a large percentage of the network load on future high speed packet
switch networks such as ATM. A major feature which distinguishes high speed
networks from traditional slower speed networks is the large amount of data the
network must manage. For efficient network usage, traffic control mechanisms are
essential. Currently, most mechanisms for traffic control (such as flow control)
have centered on the support of Available Bit Rate (ABR), i.e., non real-time,
traffic. With regard to ATM, for ABR traffic, two major types of schemes which
have been proposed are rate-control and credit-control schemes. Neither of these
schemes are directly applicable to Real-time Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic such
as continuous media traffic. Traffic control for continuous media traffic is an inherently difficult problem due to the time-sensitive nature of the traffic and its
unpredictable burstiness. In this study, we present a scheme which controls traffic by dynamically allocating/de-allocating resources among competing VCs based
upon their real-time requirements. This scheme incorporates a form of rate-control,
real-time burst-level scheduling and link-link flow control. We show analytically potential performance improvements of our rate-control scheme and present a scheme
for buffer dimensioning. We also present simulation results of our schemes and discuss the tradeoffs inherent in maintaining high network utilization and statistically
guaranteeing many users' Quality of Service.

Abstract
In this paper we present a parallel formulation of a multilevel k-way graph partitioning algorithm. The multilevel
k-way partitioning algorithm reduces the size of the graph by collapsing vertices and edges (coarsening phase), finds
a k-way partitioning of the smaller graph, and then it constructs a k-way partitioning for the original graph by projecting and refining the partition to successively finer graphs (uncoarsening phase). A key innovative feature of our
parallel formulation is that it utilizes graph coloring to effectively parallelize both the coarsening and the refinement
during the uncoarsening phase. Our algorithm is able to achieve a high degree of concurrency, while maintaining the
high quality partitions produced by the serial algorithm. We test our scheme on a large number of graphs from finite
element methods, and transportation domains. For graphs with a million vertices, our parallel formulation produces
high quality 128-way partitions on 128 processors in a little over two seconds, on Cray T3D. Thus our parallel algorithm makes it feasible to perform frequent dynamic graph partition in adaptive computations without compromising
quality.

Optimizing Multi-Join Queries in Parallel Relational Databases

//abstract
Abstract
Query optimization for parallel machines needs to
consider machine architecture, processor and memory
resources available, and different types of parallelism,
making the search space much larger than the sequential case. In this paper our aim is to determine a plan
that makes the execution of an individual query very
fast, making minimizing parallel execution time the
right objective. This creates the following circular dependence: a plan tree is needed for effective resource
assignment, which is needed to estimate the parallel
execution time, and this is needed for the cost-based
search for a good plan tree. In this paper we propose
a new search heuristic that breaks the cycle by constructing the plan tree layer by layer in a bottom-up
manner. To select nodes at the next level, the lower
and upper bounds on the execution time for plans consistent with the decisions made so far are estimated
and are used to guide the search. A query plan representation for intra- and inter-operator parallelism,
pipelining, and processor and memory assignment is
proposed. Also proposed is a new approach to estimating the parallel execution time of a plan that considers
sum and max of operators working sequentially and
in parallel, respectively. The results obtained from a
prototype optimizer are presented.

abstract: Building distributed operating systems benefits from the micro-kernel approach by allowing better support for modularization. However, we believe
that we need to take this support a step further. A more modular, or object
oriented approach is needed if we wish to cross the barrier of complexity that
is holding back distributed operating system development. The Chorus Ob
ject Oriented Layer (COOL) is a layer built above the Chorus micro-kernel
designed to extend the micro-kernel abstractions with support for object oriented systems. COOL v2, the second iteration of this layer provides generic
support for clusters of objects, in a distributed virtual memory model. It is
built as a layered system where the lowest layer support only clusters and the
upper layers support objects.

Universal Constructions for Large Objects

Dept. of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
//abstract
Abstract
We present lock-free and wait-free universal constructions for implementing large
shared objects. Most previous universal constructions require processes to copy the
entire object state, which is impractical for large objects. Previous attempts to
address this problem require programmers to explicitly fragment large objects into
smaller, more manageable pieces, paying particular attention to how such pieces are
copied. In contrast, our constructions are designed to largely shield programmers
from this fragmentation. Furthermore, for many objects, our constructions result
in lower copying overhead than previous ones.
Fragmentation is achieved in our constructions through the use of load-linked,
store-conditional, and validate operations on a "large" multi-word shared variable.
Before presenting our constructions, we show that these operations can be efficiently
implemented from similar one-word primitives.

View-Dependent Simplification Of Arbitrary Polygonal Environments

1. ABSTRACT
Hierarchical dynamic simplification (HDS) is a new approach to
the problem of simplifying arbitrary polygonal environments.
HDS operates dynamically, retessellating the scene continuously
as the users viewing position shifts, and adaptively, processing
the entire database without first decomposing the environment
into individual objects. The resulting system allows real-time
display of very complex polygonal CAD models consisting of
thousands of parts and hundreds of thousands of polygons. HDS
supports various preprocessing algorithms and various runtime
criteria, providing a general framework for dynamic view-dependent simplification.
Briefly, HDS works by clustering vertices together in a
hierarchical fashion. The simplification process continuously
queries this hierarchy to generate a scene containing only those
polygons that are important from the current viewpoint. When
the volume of space associated with a vertex cluster occupies less
than a userspecified amount of the screen, all vertices within
that cluster are collapsed together and degenerate polygons
filtered out. HDS maintains an active list of visible polygons for
rendering. Since frame-to-frame movements typically involve
small changes in viewpoint, and therefore modify the active list
by only a few polygons, the method takes advantage of temporal
coherence for greater speed.

Abstract
Precise teleoperation of dextrous robotic hands by
hand masters requires an accurate human hand model.
A kinematic model of a human index finger is developed as an example for human hand modeling. The
parameters of the model are determined by open-loop
kinematic calibration. Singular value decomposition is
used as a tool for analyzing the kinematic model and
the identification process. Accurate and reliable results are obtained only when the numerical condition
is minimized through parameter scaling, model reduction and pose set selection. The identified kinematic
parameters show the kinematic model and calibration
procedure have an accuracy on the order of a few millimeters.

Abstract
We describe the design and implementation of a persistent object storage facility
based on a dossier driven approach. Objects are characterized by dossiers which describe both their language defined and "extra-linguistic" properties. These dossiers are
generated by a C++ preprocessor in concert with an augmented, but completely C++
compatible, class description language. The design places very few burdens on the application programmer and can be used without altering the data member layout of application objects or inheriting from special classes. The storage format is kept simple to allow
the use of a variety of data storage backends. In addition, these dossiers can be used to
implement (or augment) a run-time typing facility compatible with the proposed ANSI
C++ standard. Finally, by providing a generic object to byte stream conversion the persistent object facility can also be used in conjunction with an interprocess communication
facility to provide object-level communication between processes. 1

Abstract
Software for a growing number of problem domains
has complex, time varying behavior and unpredictable
resource demands (e.g., WWW servers and parallel input/output systems). While current performance analysis tools provide insights into application dynamics
and the causes of poor performance, with a posteriori analysis one cannot adapt to temporally varying
application resource demands and system responses.
We believe that the solution to this performance optimization conundrum is integration of dynamic performance instrumentation and on-the-fly performance
data reduction with real-time adaptive control mechanisms that select and configure resource management
algorithms automatically, based on observed application behavior, or interactively, through high-modality
virtual environments. We motivate this belief by first
describing our experiences with performance analysis tools, input/output characterization, and WWW
server analysis, and then sketching the design of interactive and closed loop adaptive control systems.

Abstract. This paper describes the first results from research 1 on the
compilation of constraint systems into task level parallel programs in a
procedural language. This is the only research, of which we are aware,
which attempts to generate efficient parallel programs for numerical
computations from constraint systems. Computations are expressed as
constraint systems. A dependence graph is derived from the constraint
system and a set of input variables. The dependence graph, which exploits the parallelism in the constraints, is mapped to the target language CODE, which represents parallel computation structures as generalized dependence graphs. Finally, parallel C programs are generated.
The granularity of the derived dependence graphs depends upon the
complexity of the operations represented in the type system of the constraint specification language. To extract parallel programs of appropriate granularity, the following features have been included: (i) modularity, (ii) operations over structured types as primitives, (iii) definition
of sequential C functions. A prototype of the compiler has been implemented. The execution environment or software architecture is specified
separately from the constraint system. The domain of matrix computations has been targeted for applications. Some examples have been
programmed. Initial results are very encouraging.

Abstract
In this paper, we consider non-uniform wire-sizing. Given a
wire segment of length L, let f(x) be the width of the wire
at position x, 0 x L. We show that the optimal wire-sizing function that minimizes the Elmore delay through the
wire is f(x) = ae bx , where a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0 are constants
that can be computed in O(1) time. In the case where lower
bound (L &gt; 0) and upper bound (U &gt; 0) on the wire widths
are given, we show that the optimal wire-sizing function f(x)
is a truncated version of ae bx that can also be determined in
O(1) time. Our wire-sizing formula can be iteratively applied
to optimally size the wire segments in a routing tree.

Abstract
Qualitative reasoning uses incomplete knowledge to compute a description of the possible behaviors for dynamic
systems. For complex systems containing a large number
of variables and constraints, the simulation frequently is
intractable or results in a large, incomprehensible behavioral description. Abstraction and aggregation techniques are required during the simulation to eliminate
irrelevant details and highlight the important characteristics of the behavior. The total temporal ordering of
unrelated events provided by a traditional state-based
qualitative representation is one such irrelevant distinction. Model decomposition and simulation addresses this
problem.
Model decomposition uses a causal analysis of the model
to partition the variables into tightly connected components. The components are simulated separately in
the order dictated by the causal analysis beginning with
causally upstream components. Information from the
simulation of causally upstream components is used to
constrain the behavior of downstream components. If a
feedback loop exists between components or a set of components are acausally related, then a concurrent simulation is performed for these components. A truth maintenance system is used to record and retract assumptions
made during this concurrent simulation.
Model decomposition provides a general architecture
which separates the method of simulation from the model
decomposition algorithm. This architecture can be used
to introduce alternative abstraction techniques to eliminate other irrelevant distinctions.

Abstract
MAWL is an application language for programming interactive services in the context of the Worldwide
Web. The language is small, because no construct was introduced without compelling justification; as with
yacc [8], general-purpose computation is done in a host language. MAWL offers conveniences such as control
abstraction, persistent state management, synchronization, and shared memory. In addition, the MAWL
compiler performs static checking designed to prevent common Web programming errors. In this paper we
discuss the design and engineering of MAWL.
We describe the problems MAWL is intended to solve, and then discuss our design choices in the context
of our general language design philosophy, We also include an appendix of commentary on several short
MAWL programs.

ON UNAPPROXIMABLE VERSIONS OF NP-COMPLETE
PROBLEMS
//author
DAVID ZUCKERMAN
//abstract
Abstract.
We prove that all of Karp's 21 original NP -complete problems have a version that's hard to
approximate. These versions are obtained from the original problems by adding essentially the same,
simple constraint. We further show that these problems are absurdly hard to approximate. In fact, no
polynomial-time algorithm can even approximate log (k) of the magnitude of these problems to within
any constant factor, where log (k) denotes the logarithm iterated k times, unless N P is recognized by
slightly superpolynomial randomized machines. We use the same technique to improve the constant
* such that MAX CLIQUE is hard to approximate to within a factor of n * . Finally, we show that it
is even harder to approximate two counting problems: counting the number of satisfying assignments
to a monotone 2-SAT formula and computing the permanent of -1,0,1 matrices.

Abstract
The ideal distributed file system would provide all its users with coherent, shared access to the same set of files,yet would be arbitrarily
scalable to provide more storage space and higher performance to
a growing user community. It would be highly available in spite of
component failures. It would require minimal human administration, and administration would not become more complex as more
components were added.
Frangipani is a new file system that approximates this ideal, yet
was relatively easy to build because of its two-layer structure. The
lower layer is Petal (described in an earlier paper), a distributed
storage service that provides incrementally scalable, highly available, automatically managed virtual disks. In the upper layer,
multiple machines run the same Frangipani file system code on top
of a shared Petal virtual disk, using a distributed lock service to
ensure coherence.
Frangipani is meant to run in a cluster of machines that are under
a common administration and can communicate securely. Thus the
machines trust one another and the shared virtual disk approach is
practical. Of course, a Frangipani file system can be exported to
untrusted machines using ordinary network file access protocols.
We have implemented Frangipani on a collection of Alphas
running DIGITAL Unix 4.0. Initial measurements indicate that
Frangipani has excellent single-server performance and scales well
as servers are added.

Abstract
Message logging is a popular technique for building low-overhead protocols that tolerate
process crash failures. Past research in message logging has focused on studying the relative
overhead imposed by pessimistic, optimistic, and causal protocols during failure-free executions. In this paper, we give the first experimental evaluation of the performance of these
protocols during recovery. We discover that, if a single failure is to be tolerated, pessimistic
and causal protocols perform best, because they avoid rollbacks of correct processes. For
multiple failures, however, the dominant factor in determining performance becomes where
the recovery information is logged (i.e. at the sender, at the receiver, or replicated at a
subset of the processes in the system) rather than when this information is logged (i.e. if
logging is synchronous or asynchronous). From our results, we distil a few lessons that can
guide the design of message-logging protocols that combine low-overhead during failure-free
executions with fast recovery.

Abstract
We address the problem of broadcasting on mesh architectures with arbitrary (non-power-two) dimensions. It is assumed that such mesh architectures employ cut-through or worm-hole routing. The
primary focus is on avoiding network conflicts in the various proposed algorithms. We give algorithms
for performing a conflict-free minimum-spanning tree broadcast, a pipelined algorithm that is similar to
Ho and Johnsson's EDST algorithm for hypercubes, and a novel scatter-collect approach that is a natural
choice for communication libraries due to its simplicity. Results obtained on the Intel Paragon system
are included.

Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a new parallel library effort, as part of the PLAPACK
project, that attempts to address discrepencies between the needs of applications and
parallel libraries. A number of contributions are made, including a new approach
to matrix distribution, new insights into layering parallel linear algebra libraries, and
the application of "object based" programming techniques which have recently become
popular for (parallel) scientific libraries. We present an overview of a prototype library,
the SL Library, which incorporates these ideas. Preliminary performance data shows
this more application-centric approach to libraries does not necessarily adversely impact
performance, compared to more traditional approaches.

Abstract
This paper presents a new system, called NetSolve, that allows users to access computational resources, such as hardware and software, distributed across the network. The development of NetSolve
was motivated by the need for an easy-to-use, efficient mechanism for using computational resources remotely. Ease of use is obtained as a result of different interfaces, some of which require no programming
effort from the user. Good performance is ensured by a load-balancing policy that enables NetSolve to
use the computational resources available as efficiently as possible. NetSolve offers the ability to look
for computational resources on a network, choose the best one available, solve a problem (with retry for
fault-tolerance), and return the answer to the user.

Abstract
In this paper, we propose a definition of goal achievability: given a basic action theory describing an initial state of the world and some primitive actions available to a
robot, including some actions which return binary sensing information, what goals can
be achieved by the robot? The main technical result of the paper is a proof that a simple
robot programming language is universal, in that any effectively achievable goal can be
achieved by getting the robot to execute one of the robot programs. The significance of
this result is at least two fold. First, it is in many ways similar to the equivalence theorem between Turing machines and recursive functions, but applied to robots whose
actions are specified by an action theory. Secondly, it provides formal justifications for
using the simple robot programming language as a foundation for our work on robotics.

Abstract
Subgoal ordering is a type of control information that has received much attention
in AI planning community. In this paper we formulate precisely a subgoal ordering
in the situation calculus. We show how information about this subgoal ordering can
be deduced from the background action theory. We also show for both linear and
nonlinear planners how knowledge about this ordering can be used in a provably
correct way to avoid unnecessary backtracking.

Abstract
One way to think about STRIPS is as a mapping from databases to databases, in the following sense: Suppose we want to know what
the world would be like if an action, represented by the STRIPS operator ff, were done
in some world, represented by the STRIPS
database D 0 . To find out, simply perform
the operator ff on D 0 (by applying ff's elementary add and delete revision operators to
D 0 ). We describe this process as progressing
the database D 0 in response to the action ff.
In this paper, we consider the general problem of progressing an initial database in response to a given sequence of actions. We
appeal to the situation calculus and an axiomatization of actions which addresses the
frame problem (Reiter [13], Lin and Reiter
[8]). This setting is considerably more general than STRIPS. Our results concerning
progression are mixed. The (surprising) bad
news is that, in general, to characterize a progressed database we must appeal to second
order logic. The good news is that there are
many useful special cases for which we can
compute the progressed database in first order logic; not only that, we can do so efficiently.

Abstract
The rectilinear Steiner tree problem requires a shortest tree spanning a given vertex subset

and Berman/Ramaiyer [3] heuristics is at most 1.375 and 97
72 1:347 of the optimal length,
respectively. It was claimed that these bounds are not tight. Here we improve these bounds to
1.3125 and 61
48 1:271, respectively, and give efficient algorithms to find approximations of such
quality. We also prove that for Zelikovsky's heuristic this bound cannot be less than 1.3.

Abstract
Recent attempts at incorporating concurrency into functional languages have
identified synchronous communication via shared channels as a promising primitive. An additional useful feature found in many proposals is a nondeterministic
choice operator. Similar in nature to the CSP alternative command, this operator
allows different possible actions to be guarded by sends or receives. Choice is
difficult to implement in a distributed environment because it requires offering
many potential communications but closing only one. In this paper we present
the first distributed, deadlock-free algorithm for choice.

Abstract
The New Jersey Machine-Code Toolkit helps programmers write applications that process machine code.
Applications that use the toolkit are written at an
assembly-language level of abstraction, but they recognize and emit binary. Guided by a short instruction-set specification, the toolkit generates all the bit-manipulating code.
The toolkit's specification language uses four concepts: fields and tokens describe parts of instructions,
patterns describe binary encodings of instructions or
groups of instructions, and constructors map between
the assembly-language and binary levels. These concepts are suitable for describing both CISC and RISC
machines; we have written specifications for the MIPS
R3000, SPARC, and Intel 486 instruction sets.
We have used the toolkit to help write two applications: a debugger and a linker. The toolkit generates
efficient code; for example, the linker emits binary up
to 15% faster than it emits assembly language, making
it 1.7-2 times faster to produce an a.out directly than
by using the assembler.

Abstract
An implicit premise of existing routing methods is that the routing topology must correspond to a
tree (i.e., it does not contain cycles). In this paper we investigate the consequences of abandoning this
basic axiom, and instead we allow routing topologies that correspond to arbitrary graphs (i.e., where
cycles are allowed). We show that non-tree routing can significantly improve signal propagation delay,
reduce signal skew, and afford increased reliability with respect to open faults that may be caused by
manufacturing defects and electro-migration. Simulations on uniformly-distributed nets indicate that
depending on net size and technology parameters, our non-tree routing construction reduces maximum
sourse-sink SPICE delay by an average of up to 62%, and reduces signal skew by an average of up to
63%, as compared with Steiner routing. Moreover, up to 77% of the total wirelength in non-trees can
tolerate an open fault without disconnecting the circuit.

Abstract
Semantic query optimization refers to the process of using
integrity constraints (ic's) in order to optimize the evaluation
of queries. The process is well understood in the case
of unions of select-project-join queries (i.e., nonrecursive
datalog). For arbitrary datalog programs, however, the
issue has largely remained an unsolved problem. This
paper studies this problem and shows when semantic query
optimization can be completely done in recursive rules
provided that order constraints and negated EDB subgoals
appear only in the recursive rules, but not in the ic's.
If either order constraints or negated EDB subgoals are
introduced in ic's, then the problem of semantic query
optimization becomes undecidable. Since semantic query
optimization is closely related to the containment problem
of a datalog program in a union of conjunctive queries, our
results also imply new decidability and undecidability results
for that problem when order constraints and negated EDB
subgoals are used.

//abstract
Abstract
Though the C preprocessor provides necessary language features, it does so in an unstructured way. The lexical nature of cpp creates numerous problems for software engineers
and their tools, all stemming from the chasm between the engineer's view of the source code
and the compiler's view. The simplest way to reduce this problem is to minimize use of the
preprocessor. In light of the data collected in a prior empirical analysis, this paper describes
a tool to aid the software engineer in analyses targeted at replacing preprocessor constructs
with language features. Existing tools for analyzing C source in the context of the preprocessor are unsuitable for such transformations. This work introduces a new approach: tightly
integrating the preprocessor with a C language parser, permitting the code to be analyzed at
both the preprocessor and syntactic levels simultaneously. The front-end framework, called
PCp 3 , combines a preprocessor, a parser, and arbitrary Perl subroutine "hooks" invoked upon
various preprocessor and parser events. PCp 3 's strengths and weaknesses are discussed in the
context of several program understanding and transformation tools, including a conservative
analysis to support replacing cpp's #define directives with C++ language features.

Effective Cache Prefetching on Bus-Based Multiprocessors
//author
Dean M. Tullsen and Susan J. Eggers
//affiliation
University of Washington
//abstract
Abstract
Compiler-directed cache prefetching has the potential to hide much of the high memory latency seen by
current and future high-performance processors. However, prefetching is not without costs, particularly on a
multiprocessor. Prefetching can negatively affect bus utilization, overall cache miss rates, memory latencies and
data sharing.
We simulate the effects of a compiler-directed prefetching algorithm, running on a range of bus-based multiprocessors. We show that, despite a high memory latency, this architecture does not necessarily support prefetching
well, in some cases actually causing performance degradations. We pinpoint several problems with prefetching on
a shared memory architecture (additional conflict misses, no reduction in the data sharing traffic and associated
latencies, a multiprocessor's greater sensitivity to memory utilization and the sensitivity of the cache hit rate to
prefetch distance) and measure their effect on performance. We then solve those problems through architectural
techniques and heuristics for prefetching that could be easily incorporated into a compiler: 1) victim caching,
which eliminates most of the cache conflict misses caused by prefetching in a direct-mapped cache, 2) special
prefetch algorithms for shared data, which significantly improve the ability of our basic prefetching algorithm
to prefetch invalidation misses, and 3) compiler-based shared data restructuring, which eliminates many of the
invalidation misses the basic prefetching algorithm doesn't predict. The combined effect of these improvements
is to make prefetching effective over a much wider range of memory architectures.

Abstract
Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have been based
on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and symbolically. While there
has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current
spoken-language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or
symbolic semantic component.
In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing
of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic,
semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we
use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and
language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist
networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the screen system which is
based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis.
In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of screen's architecture, the flat
syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed
evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input.
The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of
spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we
show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support
a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall
hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.

Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive approach for model-based diagnosis which includes proposals for characterizing and computing preferred diagnoses, assuming that the
system description is augmented with a system structure (a directed graph explicating the
interconnections between system components). Specifically, we first introduce the notion of
a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses,
such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second,
we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form
(NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic
algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We
show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size
consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences
and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm
that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is
shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies
some general conditions.

Abstract
Standard safety analysis techniques are often ineffective when computers and digital devices are integrated into plant control. The Safeware methodology and its
set of supporting safety analysis techniques (and prototype tools) includes modeling
and hazard analysis of complex systems where the components may be a mixture of
humans, hardware, and software. This paper describes one of the Safeware hazard
analysis techniques, Software Deviation Analysis, that incorporates the beneficial features of HAZOP (such as guidewords, deviations, exploratory analysis, and a systems
engineering approach) into an automated procedure that is capable of handling the
complexity and logical nature of computer software.

Abstract
This paper describes PBSM (Partition Based Spatial-Merge), a new algorithm for performing spatial join operation. This algorithm is especially effective when neither of the inputs to the join have an index on the joining
attribute. Such a situation could arise if both inputs to the join are intermediate results in a complex query, or in
a parallel environment where the inputs must be dynamically redistributed. The PBSM algorithm partitions the
inputs into manageable chunks, and joins them using a computational geometry based plane-sweeping technique. This paper also presents a performance study comparing the the traditional indexed nested loops join
algorithm, a spatial join algorithm based on joining spatial indices, and the PBSM algorithm. These comparisons
are based on complete implementations of these algorithms in Paradise, a database system for handling GIS applications. Using real data sets, the performance study examines the behavior of these spatial join algorithms in a
variety of situations, including the cases when both, one, or none of the inputs to the join have an suitable index.
The study also examines the effect of clustering the join inputs on the performance of these join algorithms. The
performance comparisons demonstrates the feasibility, and applicability of the PBSM join algorithm.

Maximal-Munch Tokenization in Linear Time
//author
THOMAS REPS
//affiliation
University of Wisconsin
//abstract
The lexical-analysis (or scanning) phase of a compiler attempts to partition the input stream into a sequence of tokens.
The convention in most languages is that the input is scanned left to right, and each token identified is a maximal
munch of the remaining inputthe longest prefix of the remaining input that is a token of the language. Most textbooks on compiling have extensive discussions of lexical analysis in terms of finite-state automata and regular expressions: Token classes are defined by a set of regular expressions R i , 1 i k, and the lexical analyzer is based on some
form of finite-state automaton for recognizing the language L (R 1 + R 2 + . . . + R k ). However, the treatment is unsatisfactory in one respect: The theory of finite-state automata assumes that the end of the input stringi.e., the right-hand-side boundary of the candidate for recognitionis known a priori, whereas a scanner must identify the next token
without knowing a definite bound on the extent of the token.
Although most of the standard compiler textbooks discuss this issue, the solution they sketch out is one thatfor
certain sets of token definitionscan cause the scanner to exhibit quadratic behavior in the worst case. This property is
not only dissatisfying, it blemishes an otherwise elegant treatment of lexical analysis.
In this paper, we rectify this defect: We show that, given a deterministic finite-state automaton that recognizes the
tokens of a language, maximal-munch tokenization can always be performed in time linear in the size of the input.

Abstract
DEVise is a data exploration system that allows users to easily develop, browse, and share visual presentations of large
tabular datasets (possibly containing or referencing multimedia objects) from several sources. The DEVise framework
is being implemented in a tool that has been already successfully applied to a variety of real applications by a number
of user groups.
Our emphasis is on developing an intuitive yet powerful set of querying and visualization primitives that can be
easily combined to develop a rich set of visual presentations
that integrate data from a wide range of application domains. While DEVise is a powerful visualization tool, its
greatest strengths are the ability to interactively explore a
visual presentation of the data at any level of detail (including retrieving individual data records), and the ability to
seamlessly query and combine data from a variety of local
and remote sources. In this paper, we present the DEVise
framework, describe the current tool, and report on our experience in applying it to several real applications.

Abstract
Web caches can not only reduce network traffic and
downloading latency, but can also affect the distribution of web traffic over the network through cost-aware caching. This paper introduces GreedyDual-Size, which incorporates locality with cost and size
concerns in a simple and non-parameterized fashion
for high performance. Trace-driven simulations show
that with the appropriate cost definition, GreedyDual-Size outperforms existing web cache replacement algorithms in many aspects, including hit ratios, latency reduction and network cost reduction. In addition, GreedyDual-Size can potentially improve the
performance of main-memory caching of Web documents.

Abstract
We examine the effects of latent variables, between
individual variability and measurement error in the
outcome on commonly used methods for the analysis of longitudinal ordinal data, such as marginal
and cluster-specific models. The impact of such variability becomes very clear when viewed in the context of structural equation modeling (e.g. Muthen
1979, 1983, 1984, 1988). The structural equation
formulation also provides insight into the assumptions and differences in interpretation of regression
coefficients of these various methods of analysis. We
explore the potential for using structural equations
to model random effects and to adjust for measurement error, and in the process compare results
from marginal modeling using a SAS GEE routine
(Karim and Zeger, 1988), Qu's GAUSS program
(Qu, 1992) for generalized mixed models using GEE,
the MIXOR package for cluster-specific mixed effects models (Hedeker and Gibbons, 1994), and LIS-COMP (Muthen, 1988) for structural equation models. These approaches are illustrated in a longitudinal data set of sleep disorders.

Abstract
The techniques which are used to implement interprocedural data flow analyzers can be generally
divided into two parts: the call string and the functional approach [18]. Both differ in their time and space
complexity as well as in the preciseness due to properties of the abstract domains and transfer functions.
We have developed a data flow analyzer generator PAG [2] which is able to produce interprocedural
analyzers for both techniques. We specified two variants of constant propagation working in an ANSI-C
compiler; a copy constant propagation that uses distributive transfer function and can be solved precisely,
even interprocedurally [13], and a full constant propagator which includes an interpreter for expressions
of the language. We present the practical relevant results applying both analyzers to a rather fair set of
real-world programs and compare the space/time consumption of the analyzers versus their preciseness.

ABSTRACT
In an open network computing environment, a workstation cannot be trusted to
identify its users correctly to network services. Kerberos provides an alternative
approach whereby a trusted third-party authentication service is used to verify users'
identities. This paper gives an overview of the Kerberos authentication model as implemented for MIT's Project Athena. It describes the protocols used by clients, servers, and
Kerberos to achieve authentication. It also describes the management and replication of
the database required. The views of Kerberos as seen by the user, programmer, and
administrator are described. Finally, the role of Kerberos in the larger Athena picture is
given, along with a list of applications that presently use Kerberos for user authentication. We describe the addition of Kerberos authentication to the Sun Network File System as a case study for integrating Kerberos with an existing application.

Abstract
The complexity of parallel applications and parallel processor scheduling policies makes both exact analysis and simulation difficult, if not intractable, for large systems. In this paper we propose a new approach
to performance modeling of multiprogrammed processor scheduling policies, that of interpolation approximations. We first define a workload model that contains parameters for the essential properties of parallel
applications with respect to scheduling discipline performance, yet lends itself to mathematical analysis. Key
features of the workload model include general distribution of total job processing time, general distribution
of available job parallelism, and a simple characterization of parallelism overheads. We then show that one
can find specific values of the system parameters for which the parallel system under a given scheduling
policy reduces to a queueing system with a known (closed-form) solution. Finally, interpolation between
the points with known solutions is used to arrive at mean response time estimates that hold over the entire
system parameter space. The interpolation approximations readily yield insight into policy behavior and are
easy to evaluate for systems with hundreds of processors.
We illustrate the approach by developing and validating models of three scheduling policies, under the
assumptions of linear job execution rates and independence between job parallelism and processing time.
We discuss several insights and results obtained from the analysis of the three policies under the assumed
workloads. One result clarifies and generalizes observations in two previous simulation studies of how policy
performance varies with the coefficient of variation in job processing requirement. Another result of the
interpolation models yields new insight into how policy performance varies with job parallelism. We also
comment on the generalizations of these insights for workloads with less restrictive assumptions.

Abstract
The performance potential of run-to-completion (RTC) parallel
processor scheduling policies is investigated by examining
whether (1) application execution rate characteristics such as average parallelism (avg) and processor working set (pws) and/or (2)
limited preemption can be used to improve the performance of
these policies. We address the first question by comparing policies
(previous as well as new) that differ only in whether or not they
use execution rate characteristics and by examining a wider range
of the workload parameter space than previous studies. We address
the second question by comparing a simple two-level queueing
policy with RTC scheduling in the second level queue against
RTC policies that don't allow any preemption and against dynamic
equiallocation (EQ).
Using simulation to estimate mean response times we find that for
promising RTC policies such as adaptive static partitioning (ASP)
and shortest demand first (SDF), a maximum allocation constraint
that is for all practical purposes independent of avg and pws provides greater and more consistent improvement in policy performance than using avg or pws. Also, under the assumption that job
demand information is unavailable to the scheduler we show that
the ASP-max policy outperforms all previous high performance
RTC policies for workloads with coefficient of variation in processing requirement greater than one. Furthermore, a two-level
queue that allows at most one preemption per job outperforms
ASP-max but is not competitive with EQ.

Abstract
The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is widely used in lossy image and video compression schemes
such as JPEG and MPEG. In this paper we describe RD-OPT, an efficient algorithm for constructing
DCT quantization tables with optimal rate-distortion tradeoffs for a given image. The algorithm uses
DCT coefficient distribution statistics in a novel way and uses a dynamic programming strategy to
produce optimal quantization tables over a wide range of rates and distortions. It can be used to
compress images at any desired signal-to-noise ratio or compressed size.

Abstract
We consider the problem of software generalization: Given a program component C, create
a parameterized program component C 0 such that C 0 is usable in a wider variety of syntactic
contexts than C. Furthermore, C 0 should be a semantically meaningful generalization of C;
namely, there must exist an instantiation of C 0 that is equivalent in functionality to C.
In this paper, we present an algorithm that generalizes C functions via type inference. The
original functions operate on specific data types; the result of generalization is a collection of
C++ function templates that operate on parameterized types. This version of the generalization
problem is useful in the context of converting existing C programs to C++.

Abstract
We show the interconvertibility of context-free-language reachability problems and a class
of set-constraint problems: given a context-free-language reachability problem, we show how to
construct a set-constraint problem whose answer gives a solution to the reachability problem;
given a set-constraint problem, we show how to construct a context-free-language reachability
problem whose answer gives a solution to the set-constraint problem. The interconvertibility
of these two formalisms offers an conceptual advantage akin to the advantage gained from the
interconvertibility of finite-state automata and regular expressions in language theory, namely,
a problem can be formulated in whichever formalism is most natural. It also offers some insight into the "O(n 3 ) bottleneck" for different types of program-analysis problems, and allows
results previously obtained for context-free-language reachability problems to be applied to set
constraint problems.

Abstract. This paper provides a means for comparing various computer codes for solving large
scale mixed complementarity problems. We discuss inadequacies in how solvers are currently
compared, and present a testing environment that addresses these inadequacies. This testing
environment consists of a library of test problems, along with GAMS and MATLAB interfaces that
allow these problems to be easily accessed. The environment is intended for use as a tool by other
researchers to better understand both their algorithms and their implementations, and to direct
research toward problem classes that are currently the most challenging. As an initial benchmark,
eight different algorithm implementations for large scale mixed complementarity problems are
briefly described and tested with default parameter settings using the new testing environment.

Abstract. In this paper we examine preconditioning operators for regular elliptic
systems of partial differential operators. We obtain general conditions under which the
preconditioned systems are bounded. We also provide some useful guidelines for choosing
left and right preconditioning operators for regular elliptic systems. The condition numbers
of the discrete operators arising from these preconditioned operators are shown to be
bounded independent of grid spacing. Several examples of the two-dimensional regular
elliptic systems are discussed, including scalar elliptic operators and the Stokes operator
with several different boundary conditions. Several preconditioners for these regular elliptic
systems are presented and used in numerical experiments illustrating the theoretical results.

ABSTRACT
Software engineering applications require sophisticated
object management system support for creating and
manipulating software objects. One of the key issues for
object management systems is distribution. Addressing this issue in the context of software engineering applications is particularly challenging because they have
widely varying object access profiles. Two fundamental
approaches to dealing with distribution are the object
server architecture, where objects are shipped to the
application program, and the operation server architecture, where operation requests are shipped to where the
objects reside. We compare these architectures experimentally to determine the conditions under which each
performs better.

Abstract
In order to analyze a program that involves pointers, it
is necessary to have (safe) information about what each
pointer points to. There are many different approaches
to computing points-to information. This paper addresses techniques for flow- and context-insensitive in-terprocedural analysis of stack-based storage.
The paper makes two contributions to work in this
area:
* The first contribution is a set of experiments that
explore the trade-offs between techniques previously defined by Lars Andersen and Bjarne Steens-gaard. The former has a cubic worst-case running
time, while the latter is essentially linear. However, the former may be much more precise than
the latter. We have found that in practice, Ander-sen's algorithm is consistently more precise than
Steensgaard's. For small programs, there is very
little difference in the times required by the two
approaches; however, for larger programs, Ander-sen's algorithm can be much slower than Steens
gaard's.
* The second contribution is the definition of two
new algorithms. The first algorithm can be "tuned"
so that its worst-case time and space requirements,
as well as its accuracy range from those of Steens-gaard to those of Andersen. We have experimented
with several versions of this algorithm; one version
provided a significant increase in accuracy over
Steensgaard's algorithm, while keeping the running time within a factor of two.
The second algorithm uses the first as a subroutine. Its worst-case time and space requirements
are a factor of log N (where N is the number of
variables in the program) worse than those of
Steensgaard's algorithm. In practice, it appears to

query response time. However, the decision of
what and how much to precompute is a difficult one. It is further complicated by the fact
that precomputation in the presence of hierarchies can result in an unintuitively large increase in the amount of storage required by the
database. Hence, it is interesting and useful
to estimate the storage blowup that will result from a proposed set of precomputations
without actually computing them. We propose
three strategies for this problem: one based on
sampling, one based on mathematical approximation, and one based on probabilistic counting. We investigate the accuracy of these algorithms in estimating the blowup for different
data distributions and database schemas. The
algorithm based upon probabilistic counting is
particularly attractive, since it estimates the
storage blowup to within provable error bounds
while performing only a single scan of the data.

Abstract
An important problem faced by many database management
systems is the "online object placement problem"|the
problem of choosing a disk page to hold a newly allocated
object. In the absence of clustering criteria, the goal is
to maximize storage utilization. For main-memory based
systems, simple heuristics exist that provide reasonable
space utilization in the worst case and excellent utilization
in typical cases. However, the storage management problem
for databases includes significant additional challenges, such
as minimizing I/O traffic, coping with crash recovery, and
gracefully integrating space management with locking and
logging.
We survey several object placement algorithms, including
techniques that can be found in commercial and research
database systems. We then present a new object placement
algorithm that we have designed for use in Shore, an
object-oriented database system under development at the
University of Wisconsin|Madison. Finally, we present
results from a series of experiments involving actual Shore
implementations of some of these algorithms. Our results
show that while current object placement algorithms have
serious performance deficiencies, including excessive CPU
or main memory overhead, I/O traffic, or poor disk
utilization, our new algorithm consistently demonstrates
excellent performance in all of these areas.

Abstract
A number of efficient learning algorithms achieve exact identification of an unknown function
from some class using membership and equivalence queries. Using a standard transformation
such algorithms can easily be converted to on-line learning algorithms that use membership
queries. Under such a transformation the number of equivalence queries made by the query
algorithm directly corresponds to the number of mistakes made by the on-line algorithm. In
this paper we consider several of the natural classes known to be learnable in this setting, and
investigate the minimum number of equivalence queries with accompanying counterexamples
(or equivalently the minimum number of mistakes in the on-line model) that can be made by a
learning algorithm that makes a polynomial number of membership queries and uses polynomial
computation time. We are able both to reduce the number of equivalence queries used by the
previous algorithms and often to prove matching lower bounds. As an example, consider the
class of DNF formulas over n variables with at most k = O(log n) terms. Previously, the
algorithm of Blum and Rudich [BR92] provided the best known upper bound of 2 O(k) log n for
the minimum number of equivalence queries needed for exact identification. We greatly improve
on this upper bound showing that exactly k counterexamples are needed if the learner knows k a
priori and exactly k +1 counterexamples are needed if the learner does not know k a priori. This
exactly matches known lower bounds [BC92]. For many of our results we obtain a complete
characterization of the tradeoff between the number of membership and equivalence queries
needed for exact identification. The classes we consider here are monotone DNF formulas, Horn
sentences, O(log n)-term DNF formulas, read-k sat-j DNF formulas, read-once formulas over
various bases, and deterministic finite automata.

Optimal Solution of Off-line and On-line Generalized Caching
//author

Washington University in St. Louis
//abstract
Abstract. Network traffic can be reduced significantly if caching is utilized effectively. As an effort
in this direction we study the replacement problem
that arises in caching of multimedia objects. The size
of objects and the cost of cache misses are assumed
non-uniform. The non-uniformity of size is inherent in multimedia objects, and the non-uniformity of
cost is due to the non-uniformity of size and the fact
that the objects are scattered throughout the network.
Although a special case of this problem, i.e. the case
of uniform size and cost, has been extensively studied, the general case needs a great deal of study. We
present a dynamic programming method of optimally
solving the off-line and on-line versions of this problem, and discuss the complexity of this method.

Abstract
High-performance Web servers are essential to meet the growing demands of the Internet and large-scale intranets. Satisfying these demands requires a thorough understanding of key
factors affecting Web server performance. This paper presents
empirical analysis illustrating how dynamic and static adaptivity can enhance Web server performance. Two research
contributions support this conclusion.
First, the paper presents results from a comprehensive empirical study of Web servers (such as Apache, Netscape Enterprise, PHTTPD, Zeus, and JAWS) over high-speed ATM networks. This study illustrates their relative performance and
precisely pinpoints the server design choices that cause performance bottlenecks. We found that once network and disk
I/O overheads are reduced to negligible constant factors, the
main determinants of Web server performance are its protocol processing path and concurrency strategy. Moreover, no
single strategy performs optimally for all load conditions and
traffic types.
Second, we describe the design techniques and optimizations used to develop JAWS, our high-performance, adaptive
Web server. JAWS is an object-oriented Web server that was
explicitly designed to alleviate the performance bottlenecks
we identified in existing Web servers. It consistently outperforms all other Web servers over ATM networks. The performance optimizations used in JAWS include adaptive pre-spawned threading, fixed headers, cached date processing,
and file caching. In addition, JAWS uses a novel software architecture that substantially improves its portability and flex

MINIMIZING MEMORY CACHE USAGE FOR MULTIGRID
ALGORITHMS IN TWO DIMENSIONS
//author
CRAIG C. DOUGLAS
//abstract
Abstract. Computers today rely heavily on good utilization of their cache memory subsystems.
Compilers are optimized for business applications, not scientific computing ones, however. Automatic
tiling of basic numerical algorithms is simply not provided by any compiler. Thus, absolutely terrible
cache performance is normal for scientific computing applications.
Multigrid algorithms combine several numerical algorithms into a more complicated algorithm.
In this paper, an algorithm is derived that allows for data to pass through cache exactly once per
multigrid level during a V cycle before the level changes. This is optimal cache usage for large
problems that do not fit entirely in cache.
The new algorithm would appear to be quite complicated to implement, leading to spaghetti
coding. Actually, an efficient implementation of the algorithm requires a rigid, highly structured
coding style. A coding example is given that is suitable for almost all common discretization methods.
Numerical experiments are provided that show that the new algorithm is up to an integer factor
faster than the traditional implementation method for common multigrid parameter choices.

Abstract. We study a method for parallel solution of elliptic partial differential equations which

as a preconditioner. Bounds on the resulting convergence factors and condition numbers are given.

//abstract
Abstract. Matrix-matrix multiplication is normally computed using one of the BLAS or a
reinvention of part of the BLAS. Unfortunately, the BLAS were designed with small matrices in
mind. When huge, well conditioned matrices are multiplied together, the BLAS perform like the
blahs, even on vector machines. For matrices where the coefficients are well conditioned, Winograd's
variant of Strassen's algorithm offers some relief, but is rarely available in a quality form on most
computers. We reconsider this method and offer a highly portable solution based on the Level 3
BLAS interface.

Constructing Logic Programs with
Higher-Order Predicates 1

//abstract
Abstract: This paper proposes a logic programming approach based on the
application of a system of higher-order predicates put at disposal within ordinary logic programming languages such as prolog. These higher-order
predicates parallel the higher-order functionals or combinators which form an
established part of contemporary functional programming methodology.
The suggested toolbox of higher-order predicates for composing logic programs
is derived from one universal higher-order predicate. They take the form of
recursion operators (in particular for expressing recursion along lists) intended
to cover all commonly occurring recursion schemes in logic programming practice. Their theoretical sufficiency is proved and their practical adequacy is
argued through examples.
The recursion operators, denoting higher-order relations rather than functions, are brought about straightforwardly through a well-known metalogic
programming technique, rendering superfluous the need for special higher-order unification mechanisms.

Abstract
In this paper we present co-transformation, a novel approach to the mapping of execution information from the
source code of a program to the object code for the purpose of worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis. Our
approach is designed to handle the problems introduced by
optimizing compilers, i.e. that the structure of the object
code is very different from the structure of the source code.
The co-transformer allows us to keep track of how different compiler transformations, including optimizations, influence the execution time of a program. This allows us to
statically calculate the execution time of a program at the
object code level, using information about the program execution obtained at the source code level.

Abstract
This looks at the issues which arose in porting the pvmmake utility
from PVM to MPI. Pvmmake is a PVM application which allows
a user to send files, execute commands, and receive results from a
single machine on any machine in the virtual machine. Its actions are
controlled by the contents of a configuration file. Its most common
use is to enable management of the development of a parallel program
in a heterogeneous environment. A utility with the same features,
mpimake, was coded up to run under LAM.
Genetic programming is an algorithm which evolves an algorithm
in the form of a program to solve your input problem. The implementation under MPI requires the transfer of dynamic data structures
such as lists and trees. This paper discusses the match between the
requirements of this algorithm and the datatype feature in MPI. A
new library, MPI DataStruct is being developed which can transfer
dynamic data structures, created with pointers, without intervention
by the user.

Abstract. In the modern Internet environment, various types of
data sources have become accessible, including multimedia data and web
pages. Some of the fundamental assumptions in traditional databases,
such as the existence of a global schema and data consistency maintained
by a Data Base Administrator, are no longer true in many of the new
data sources. We outline the DIOM [LP95b] object-oriented approach
to build interoperable heterogeneous information systems despite the
absence of global schema and the presence of data inconsistency. We describe the metadata catalog management component of DIOM, a key service in the support for interoperation among heterogeneous information
sources. To support a flexible and customizable conection between information consumers and information producers, DIOM metadata catalog
development utilizes the adaptive specification mechanisms, provided in
DIOM interface description language, for explicit description of information consumers' domain query requirements and for object-oriented
abstractions of information producers' information sources.

functionality and performance expected and required of commercial products. Researchers at Carnegie
Mellon University, the Open Software Foundation, and other sites are investigating implementations of a
number of operating systems (e.g., Unix 1 , MS-DOS 2 ) that use the Mach microkernel. This paper describes
the Mach microkernel, its use to support implementations of other operating systems, and the status of these

//abstract
Abstract. We present a technique to study relations between weak and
strong fi-normalisations in various typed -calculi. We first introduce a
translation which translates a -term into a I-term, and show that a
-term is strongly fi-normalisable if and only if its translation is weakly
fi-normalisable. We then prove that the translation preserves typability
of -terms in various typed -calculi. This enables us to establish the
equivalence between weak and strong fi-normalisations in these typed
-calculi. This translation can deal with Curry typing as well as Church
typing, strengthening some recent closely related results. This may bring
some insights into answering whether weak and strong fi-normalisations
in all pure type systems are equivalent.

Abstract
This paper describes work on the linguistic
analysis of texts within a project devoted to
knowledge acquisition from text. We focus
on syntactic processing and present some
key elements of the projects parser that
allow it to deal successfully with technical
texts. The parser is fully implemented and
tested on a variety of real texts;
improvements and enhancements are in
progress. Because our knowledge acquisition
method assumes no a priori model of the
domain of the source text, the parser relies
as much as possible on lexical and syntactic
clues. That is why it strives for full
syntactic analysis rather than some form of
text skimming. We present a practical
approach to four acknowledged difficult
problems which to date have no generally
acceptable answers: phrase attachment; time
constraints for problematic input (how to
avoid long and unproductive computation);
parsing conjoined structures (how to
preserve broad coverage without losing
control of the parsing process); and the
treatment of fragmentary input or fragments
that are a byproduct of a fallback parsing
strategy. We review recent related work and
conclude by listing several future work
items.

Abstract
In the verification of cryptographic protocols along the
approach of the logic for authentication by Burrows,
Abadi, and Needham, it is possible to write a specification which does not faithfully represent the real world
situation. Such a specification, though impossible or
unreasonable to implement, can go undetected and be
verified to be correct. It can also lead to logical statements that do not preserve causality, which in turn can
have undesirable consequences. Such a specification,
called an infeasible specification here, can be subtle and
hard to locate. This note shows how the logic of cryptographic protocols by Gong, Needham, and Yahalom
can be enhanced with a notion of eligibility to preserve
causality of beliefs and detect infeasible specifications.
It is conceivable that this technique can be adopted in
other similar logics.

Abstract
A distributed security architecture is proposed for
incorporation into group oriented distributed systems,
and in particular, into the Isis distributed programming toolkit. The primary goal of the architecture is
to make common group oriented abstractions robust
in hostile settings, in order to facilitate the construction of high performance distributed applications that
can tolerate both component failures and malicious attacks. These abstractions include process groups and
causal group multicast. Moreover, a delegation and
access control scheme is proposed for use in group
oriented systems. The focus of the paper is the security architecture; particular cryptosystems and key
exchange protocols are not emphasized.

We propose a formal policy framework of MAC policies in multilevel relational databases.
We identify the important components of such policies and their desirable properties. The
framework provides a basis for systematically specifying such policies and characterizing
their potential mismatches. Based on the framework, we compare and unify the MAC
policies and policy components that are proposed in the literature or imposed in existing
systems. Our framework could be used to capture and resolve MAC policy mismatches in
the trusted interoperation of heterogeneous multilevel relational databases.

Abstract| Common security models such as Bell-LaPadula
focus on the control of access to sensitive data but leave
some important systems issues unspecified, such as the implementation of read-only objects, garbage collection, and
object upgrade and downgrade paths. Consequently, different implementations of the same security model may have
conflicting operational and security semantics. We propose
the use of more expressive security labels for specifying these
system issues within the security model, so that the semantics of a system design are precisely understood and are
independent of implementation details.

Abstract
This paper first gives an overview of standard PROLOG indexing and
then shows, in a step-by-step manner, how it can be improved by slightly
extending the WAM indexing instruction set to allow indexing on multiple
arguments. Heuristics are described that overcome the difficulty of computing the indexing WAM code. In order to become independent from a
concrete WAM instruction set, an abstract graphical representation based
on DAGs (called DAXes) is introduced.
The paper includes a COMMON LISP listing of the main heuristics
implemented; the algorithms were developed for RELFUN, a relational-plus-functional language, but can easily be used in arbitrary PROLOG
implementations.

Abstract. A relational-functional kernel language is introduced that
integrates essential declarative constructs: logic variables and non-determinism from the relational paradigm with nested and higher-order operations from the functional paradigm. Operator definitions use
`valued clauses', subsuming relational Horn clauses and functional
(conditional or unconditional) directed equations. Their semantics complements the atoms in relational Herbrand models by `molecules', which
pair functions, applied to argument terms, with returned-value terms.
All abstract notions are illustrated by concrete declarative programs.

Abstract
As semiconductor technology enters the deep submicron era, reliability has
become a major challenge in the design and manufacturing of next generation
VLSI circuits. In this paper we focus on one reliability issue the antenna
effect in the context of 3-layer channel routing. We first present an antenna effect model in 3-layer channel routing and, based on this, an antenna effect cost
function is proposed. A layer reassignment approach is adopted to minimize this
cost function and we show that the layer reassignment problem can be formulated as a network bipartitioning problem. Experimental results show that the
antenna effect can be reduced considerably by applying the proposed technique.
Compared with previous work, one advantage of our approach is that no extra
channel area is required for antenna effect minimization. We show that layer
reassignment technique can be used in yield-related critical area minimization
in 3-layer channel routing as well. The trade-off between these two objectives is
also presented.

Abstract
Crosstalk has become a major issue in VLSI design due to the high frequency, long
interconnecting lines and small spacing between interconnects in today's integrated circuits.
In this paper, we study the problem of crosstalk minimization in 3-layer HVH channel
routing. A heuristic algorithm that combines layer reassignment and track reassignment
is presented. This algorithm can iteratively modify the layout so that the crosstalk in the
channel is minimized. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can reduce the
crosstalk by an average of 16.4% on a set of benchmark examples.

Abstract
Communication networks shared by selfish users are
considered and modeled as noncooperative repeated
games. Each user is interested only in optimizing its
own performance by controlling the routing of its load.
We investigate the existence of a NEP that achieves
the system-wide optimal cost. The existence of a NEP
that not only achieves the system-wide optimal cost but
also yields a cost for each user no greater than its stage
game NEP cost is shown for two-node multiple link networks. It is shown that more general networks where
all users have the same source-destination pair have
a NEP that achieves the minimum total system cost
under a mild technical condition. It is shown general
networks with users having multiple source-destination
pairs don't necessarily have such an NEP.

Abstract
We study the following problem: two agents Alice and Bob are connected to each other by independent discrete memoryless channels. They
wish to generate common randomness by communicating interactively over
the two channels. Assuming that Alice and Bob are allowed access to
independent external random sources at rates (in bits per step of communication) of H A and H B , respectively, we show that they can generate common randomness at a rate of max f min [H A + H(W jQ); I(P ; V )] +
min [H B + H(V jP ); I(Q; W )] g bits per step. Here, V is the channel from
Alice to Bob, and W is the channel from Bob to Alice. The maximum
is over all probability distributions P and Q on the input alphabets of V
and W respectively. We also prove a strong converse which establishes the
above rate as the highest attainable in this situation.

TIME-FREQUENCY SIGNAL MODELS FOR MUSIC ANALYSIS,
TRANSFORMATION, AND SYNTHESIS
//author

//affiliation

University of California at Berkeley
//abstract
ABSTRACT
In signal analysis-synthesis, the analysis derives a set of parameters that the synthesis uses to reconstruct the original
signal. In musical applications, this reconstruction should
be perceptually accurate, and the parameterization should
allow for such desirable signal modifications as time-scaling,
pitch-shifting, and cross-synthesis; the analysis parameters
should correspond to a signal model that is flexible enough
to allow these transformations. Sinusoidal modeling meets
this flexibility requirement, but has difficulty representing
some salient features of musical signals such as attack transients and noiselike processes. In this paper, sinusoidal
modeling is reviewed and some variations are proposed to
account for its shortcomings; also, wavelet-based representations of musical signals are considered.

Abstract. We present a formal model for concurrent systems. The model represents
synchronous and asynchronous components in a uniform framework that supports compositional (assume-guarantee) and hierarchical (stepwise-refinement) design and verification. While synchronous models are based on a notion of atomic computation step,
and asynchronous models remove that notion by introducing stuttering, our model is
based on a flexible notion of what constitutes a computation step: by applying an abstraction operator to a system, arbitrarily many consecutive steps can be collapsed into
a single step. The abstraction operator, which may turn an asynchronous system into a
synchronous one, allows us to describe systems at various levels of temporal detail. For
describing systems at various levels of spatial detail, we use a hiding operator that may
turn a synchronous system into an asynchronous one. We illustrate the model with diverse examples from synchronous circuits, asynchronous shared-memory programs, and
synchronous message-passing protocols.

Capacity, Mutual Information, and Coding
for Finite-State Markov Channels
//author
Andrea J. Goldsmith , Member, IEEE and Pravin P. Varaiya , Fellow, IEEE
//abstract
Abstract
The Finite-State Markov Channel (FSMC) is a discrete-time varying channel whose variation is determined by a finite-state Markov process. These channels have memory due to the
Markov channel variation. We obtain the FSMC capacity as a function of the conditional channel
state probability. We also show that for i.i.d. channel inputs, this conditional probability converges
weakly, and the channel's mutual information is then a closed-form continuous function of the input
distribution.
We next consider coding for FSMCs. In general, the complexity of maximum-likelihood
decoding grows exponentially with the channel memory length. Therefore, in practice, interleaving
and memoryless channel codes are used. This technique results in some performance loss relative
to the inherent capacity of channels with memory. We propose a maximum-likelihood decision-feedback decoder with complexity that is independent of the channel memory. We calculate the
capacity and cutoff rate of our technique, and show that it preserves the capacity of certain FSMCs.
We also compare the performance of the decision-feedback decoder with that of interleaving and
memoryless channel coding on a fading channel with 4PSK modulation.

//abstract
Abstract
Most caching schemes in wide-area, distributed systems are client-initiated. Decisions of when and
where to cache information are made without the benefit of the server's global knowledge of the usage
patterns. In this paper, we present a new caching strategy: geographical push-caching. Using the server's
global knowledge and a derived network topology, we distribute data to cooperating servers. The World
Wide Web is an example of a wide-area system that will benefit from distance-sensitive caching, and we
present an architecture that allows a Web server to autonomously replicate HTML pages. We use a trace-driven simulation to evaluate several competing caching strategies. Our results show that geographical
push-caching reduces bandwidth consumption and sever load by the same amount as web proxy caching,
but with a savings in global cache space of almost two orders of magnitude. More importantly, servers
that wish to reduce Internet bandwidth consumption and their load can do so without waiting for web
proxies to be implemented world-wide. Furthermore, geographical push-caching helps distribute server
load for all web servers, not just the most popular as is the case with proxy caching.

Abstract
The objective of this paper is to develop models that
characterize the communication performance of a message-passing multicomputer by taking the IBM SP2 as a case
study. The paper evaluates and models the three aspects
of the communication performance: scheduling overhead,
message-passing time, and synchronization overhead. Performance models are developed for the basic communication patterns, enabling the estimation of the communication
times of a message-passing application. Such estimates facilitate activities such as application tuning, selection of the
best available implementation technique, and performance
comparisons among different multicomputers.

Abstract
Modulo scheduling algorithms based on optimal
solvers have been proposed to investigate and tune the
performance of modulo scheduling heuristics. While
recent advances have broadened the scope for which
the optimal approach is applicable, this approach
increasingly suffers from large execution times. In this
paper, we propose a more efficient formulation of the
modulo scheduling space that significantly decreases
the execution time of solvers based on integer linear
programs. For example, the total execution time is
reduced by a factor of 8.6 when 782 loops from the
Perfect Club, SPEC, and Livermore Fortran Kernels
are scheduled for minimum register requirements using
the more efficient formulation instead of the traditional
formulation. Experimental evidence further indicates
that significantly larger loops can be scheduled under
realistic machine constraints.

Abstract
Most of the recent color recognition/indexing approaches concentrate on establishing invariance to illumination color to improve the utility of color recognition. However, other effects caused by illumination pose and specularity on three-dimensional
object surfaces have not received notable attention. We present a chromaticity recognition method that discounts the effects of illumination pose, illumination color and
specularity. It utilizes a chromaticity space based on log-ratio of sensor responses for
illumination pose and color invariance. A model-based specularity detection/rejection
algorithm can be used to improve the chromaticity recognition and illumination estimation for objects including specular reflections.

Abstract
As the use of the Internet for electronic commerce, audio
and video conferencing, and other applications with sensitive content grows, the need for secure services becomes
critical. Central to the success of these services is the support for secure public key distribution. Although there are
several existing services available for this purpose, they
are not very scalable, either because they depend on a centralized server or rely on ad hoc trust relationships.
In this paper, we present and examine a flexible approach to certificate distribution scalable to arbitrarily
large networks. We propose a two level hierarchy where
certificates can be independently authenticated by one or
more peer authorities, called keyservers. Certificates for
end-user and host entities are managed within local domains, called enterprises. By administering certificates
close to the source, we reduce the load on the key servers
and the effects of network topology changes. We describe
the design of our system and present a preliminary performance analysis based on traces of present-day DNS requests.

Recent developments have clarified the process of generating partially ordered, partially specified sequences of actions whose execution
will achive an agent's goal. This paper summarizes a progression of
least commitment planners, starting with one that handles the sim
ple strips representation, and ending with one that manages actions
with disjunctive precondition, conditional effects and universal quantification over dynamic universes. Along the way we explain how
Chapman's formulation of the Modal Truth Criterion is misleading
and why his NP-completeness result for reasoning about plans with
conditional effects does not apply to our planner.

ABSTRACT
Some of the advanced real-time systems being proposed, such as the Next Generation Workstation/Machine
Controller (NGC) for automated factories, require a built-in database to support concurrent data access and provide
well-defined interfaces between software modules. However, conventional database systems do not provide the performance levels or response time guarantees needed by real-time applications. To address the need for high-performance
real-time database systems, we propose to design, implement, and evaluate an object-oriented software system called
Multiprocessor Database Architecture for Real-Time Systems (MDARTS). An important feature of MDARTS is that
it supports explicit specification of real-time requirements and semantic constraints at an object-granularity level.
The database examines these specifications at runtime during application initialization and dynamically adjusts
its data management strategy accordingly to provide hard real-time guarantees. For maximum performance on
shared-memory multiprocessors, MDARTS supports concurrent, direct, shared-memory data access. Prior real-time
database systems do not support per-object dynamic configuration during initialization, and they either work only on
uniprocessors or use relatively slow inter-process communication for all transactions. The unique design of MDARTS
will support a transaction execution time two to three orders of magnitude faster than current real-time database
systems for multiprocessors. For data access with less stringent timing constraints, MDARTS also supports remote
transactions across networks and provides interfaces to external database systems. Once we have implemented the
basic MDARTS architecture, we will demonstrate its capabilities by using it to develop distributed, open architecture
controllers for actual manufacturing machine tools.

Abstract
This paper examines the network inter-domain routing information exchanged between backbone service providers at
the major U.S. public Internet exchange points. Internet
routing instability, or the rapid fluctuation of network reach-ability information, is an important problem currently facing the Internet engineering community. High levels of network instability can lead to packet loss, increased network
latency and time to convergence. At the extreme, high levels of routing instability have lead to the loss of internal
connectivity in wide-area, national networks. In this paper,
we describe several unexpected trends in routing instability,
and examine a number of anomalies and pathologies observed in the exchange of inter-domain routing information.
The analysis in this paper is based on data collected from
BGP routing messages generated by border routers at five
of the Internet core's public exchange points during a nine
month period. We show that the volume of these routing updates is several orders of magnitude more than expected and
that the majority of this routing information is redundant,
or pathological. Furthermore, our analysis reveals several
unexpected trends and ill-behaved systematic properties in
Internet routing. We finally posit a number of explanations
for these anomalies and evaluate their potential impact on
the Internet infrastructure.

Abstract
This paper presents an hierarchical end-to-end
analysis technique that decomposes the very complex
heterogeneous multi-resource scheduling problem into
a set of single resource scheduling problems with well
defined interactions. We define heterogeneity both in
resource types, e.g., CPU, and in scheduling policies,
e.g., rate-monotonic scheduling. This analysis
technique is one phase of our systems integration
framework for designing large-scale, heterogeneous,
distributed real-time systems whose timing properties
can be strictly controlled and analyzed. This approach,
denoted the Distributed Pipelining Framework,
exploits the natural pipelining execution pattern found
in a large number of continuous (periodic) applications
executing over heterogenous resources. A teleconference application is used in this paper to show the
utility of the approach.

Abstract
The construction of rational agents is one of the goals that has been pursued in
Artificial Intelligence (AI). In most of the architectures that have been proposed for
this kind of agents, its behaviour is guided by its set of beliefs. In our work, rational
agents are those systems that are permanently engaged in the process of rational
inquiry; thus, their beliefs keep evolving in time, as a consequence of their internal
inference procedures and their interaction with the environment. Both AI researchers
and philosophers are interested in having a formal model of this process, and this is
the main topic in our work.
Beliefs have been formally modelled in the last decades using doxastic logics. The
possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they seem to commit us to model agents that are logically
omniscient and perfect reasoners. We avoid these problems by replacing possible
worlds by conceivable situations, which are all the situations that the modelled agent
is capable of considering.
In this document we show how this notion of conceivable situations may be used
to model the process of rational inquiry in which a non-ideal rational agent is engaged. We define a wide class of agents, called rational inquirers, which are a general
abstraction of any kind of non-ideal agent. We show how the beliefs of these kind of
agents evolve in time as a consequence of a multi-dimensional belief analysis, and we
use the framework of conceivable situations in order to model this evolution.

This paper describes a general-purpose programming technique, called the Simulation of

It relieves the programmer from the task to provide a consistent treatment for every single
special case that can occur. The programs that use the technique tend to be considerably
smaller and more robust than those that do not use it. We believe that this technique will
become a standard tool in writing geometric software.

Abstract. The simple Bayesian classifier is known to be optimal when attributes are independent
given the class, but the question of whether other sufficient conditions for its optimality exist has
so far not been explored. Empirical results showing that it performs surprisingly well in many
domains containing clear attribute dependences suggest that the answer to this question may be
positive. This article shows that, although the Bayesian classifier's probability estimates are only
optimal under quadratic loss if the independence assumption holds, the classifier itself can be
optimal under zero-one loss (misclassification rate) even when this assumption is violated by a
wide margin. The region of quadratic-loss optimality of the Bayesian classifier is in fact a second-order infinitesimal fraction of the region of zero-one optimality. This implies that the Bayesian
classifier has a much greater range of applicability than previously thought. For example, in this
article it is shown to be optimal for learning conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they
violate the independence assumption. Further, studies in artificial domains show that it will often
outperform more powerful classifiers for common training set sizes and numbers of attributes, even
if its bias is a priori much less appropriate to the domain. This article's results also imply that
detecting attribute dependence is not necessarily the best way to extend the Bayesian classifier,
and this is also verified empirically.

ABSTRACT
Speech disfluencies (such as filled pauses, repetitions, restarts) are
among the characteristics distinguishing spontaneous speech from
planned or read speech. We introduce a language model that predicts disfluencies probabilistically and uses an edited, fluent context
to predict following words. The model is based on a generalization
of the standard N-gram language model. It uses dynamic programming to compute the probability of a word sequence, taking into
account possible hidden disfluency events. We analyze the model's performance for various disfluency types on the Switchboard
corpus. We find that the model reduces word perplexity in the
neighborhood of disfluency events; however, overall differences
are small and have no significant impact on recognition accuracy.
We also note that for modeling of the most frequent type of dis-fluency, filled pauses, a segmentation of utterances into linguistic
(rather than acoustic) units is required. Our analysis illustrates a
generally useful technique for language model evaluation based on
local perplexity comparisons.

We present a computational model of how verbs might be learned within
the limited domain of hand actions. We hypothesize that such verbs refer to
the activities of underlying motor schemas, and leverage this constraint to
build a system with strong enough biases that it can learn from a reasonably
small number of examples, while still having adequate flexibility to learn the
hand-action verbs of any language. The completed system should demonstrate its knowledge both by labelling its own behavior and by carrying out
verbal commands in a simulated world.

Abstract
We are analyzing storage structures for two and three dimensional raster type data which are used
for feature retrieval. The features are one, two or three dimensional objects with regular outlines
like a rectangle or a prism. The features could be parts of a map or image, an area of special
interest for searching after oil, a sequence of ultra sound images, and so on. The storage medium
is magnetic disk. The data are stored in chunks or blocks representing a regular part of the source
object. We analyze the shape and the size to minimize the cost of retrieval. The optimization is
based on minimum time to do retrieval. We have five combinations: Lines and areas from areas and
volumes, and volumes from volumes. The optimal block sizes for random retrieval varies, with case,
feature size and disk characteristics. One general observation is that longer disk tracks gives larger
blocks. For line retrieval the optimal block size is only depending on disk track length. For other
cases it is also depending on the feature size. For partly sequential retrieval the block size is not the
actual block size used during retrieval, but the smallest addressing unit, and the optimal addressing
unit could be rather small.
The analysis reveals that using too small blocks could be very costly. The time could easily
double or triple if small blocks are used. In many cases the optimal block size is several tracks.

Abstract
In a database system, read operations are much more
common than write operations, and consequently, database
systems have been read optimized. As the size of main memory increases, more of the database read requests will be satisfied from the buffer system, and the amount of disk write
operations relative to disk read operations will increase.
This calls for a focus on write optimized database systems.
In this paper, we present solutions to this problem. We describe in detail the data structures and algorithms needed
to realize a write optimized object-oriented database system
in the context of Vagabond, an OODB currently being implemented at our department. In Vagabond, focus has been
to provide support for applications which have earlier used
file systems because of the limited data bandwidth in current
database systems, typical examples are super computing applications and geographical information systems

On the Computational Requirements of

Abstract
The computational requirements of high-quality, real-time rendering exceeds the limits of
generally available computing power. However illumination effects, except shadows, are
less noticeable on moving pictures. Shadows can be produced with the same techniques
used for visibility computations, therefore the basic requirements of real-time rendering
are transformations, pre-selection of the part of the scene to be displayed and visibility
computations. Transformations scale well, ie, their time requirement grows linearly with
the input size. Pre-selection, if implemented by the traditional way of polygon clipping,
has a growing rate of N log N in the worst case, where N is the total number of edges in
the scene. Visibility computations, exhibiting a quadratic growing rate, are the bottleneck
from a theoretical point of view. Three approaches are discussed to speed up visibility
computations: (i) reducing the expected running time to O(N log N ) (ii) using approximation algorithms with O(N K) worst-case time, where K is the linear resolution of the
image, and (iii) applying parallel techniques leading to logarithmic time in the worst-case.
Though the growing rate of the time requirement of pre-selection is significantly slower
than that of visibility, it is demonstrated that pre-selection has to deal with a significantly
higher amount of data than visibility computations, as the average clipping volume is 1/27
of the volume of the model.

Abstract
We describe the implementation of a multi-purpose data analysis laboratory, DataLab-J, in
the programming language Java. We briefly trace the stages of the evolution of DataLab from a
FORTRAN-IV system in 1973 to the current Java development. Description of this evolution allows
us to discuss some key design and functionality decisions and issues that arose throughout the years;
many of these issues remain topical, so, in addition to an evaluation of Java, we identify and discuss
what are for us the major issues in the design of such software. Moreover, we address questions
raised by the need to convert legacy systems, e.g. those programmed in C and various versions of
FORTRAN. The experience of redesign and implementation in Java is described, together with a
brief evaluation of the suitability of Java for 'number-crunching'. Overall conclusions are drawn,
regarding design of such software, lessons learned, traps to avoid, and on Java itself.

Abstract. We describe the core of a rule-based CQL, devoted to the

simple and declarative way to restructure and query tables, and the constraints allow to define cell contents by formulas over concrete domains.
We define a model-theoretic semantics and develop an equivalent fixpoint
theory that leads to a naive evaluation procedure.

ABSTRACT
We present recent work on integration of visual information (automatic lip-reading) with acoustic speech for better overall speech recognition. A Multi-State Time Delay
Neural Network performs the recognition of spelled letter
sequences taking advantage of lip images from a standard
camera. The problems addressed include efficient but effective representation of the visual information and optimum
manner of combining the two modalities when rendering a
decision. We show results for several alternatives to direct
gray level image as the visual evidence. These are: Principal
Components, Linear Discriminants, and DFT coefficients.
Dimensionality of the input is decreased by a factor of 12
while maintaining recognition rates. Combination of the
visual and acoustic information is performed at three different levels of abstraction. Results suggest that integration
of higher order input features works best. On a continuous
spelling task, visual-alone recognition of 45-55%, when combined with acoustic data, lowers audio-alone error rates by
30-40%.

ABSTRACT
A stochastically based approach for the semantic analysis component of a natural spoken language system for the ATIS task has been
developed. The semantic analyzer of the spoken language system
already in use at LIMSI makes use of a rule-based case grammar. In
this work, the system of rules for the semantic analysis is replaced
with a relatively simple, first order Hidden Markov Model. The
performance of the two approaches can be compared because they
use identical semantic representations despite their rather different
methods for meaning extraction. We use an evaluation methodology
that assesses performance at different semantic levels, including the
database response comparison used in the ARPA ATIS paradigm.

Abstract
In this paper we consider the problem of tracking a subset of a domain (called the target) which
changes gradually over time. A single (unknown) probability distribution over the domain is used
to generate random examples for the learning algorithm and measure the speed at which the target
changes.
Clearly, the more rapidly the target moves, the harder it is for the algorithm to maintain a good
approximation of the target. Therefore we evaluate algorithms based on how much movement of
the target can be tolerated between examples while predicting with accuracy *. Furthermore, the
complexity of the class H of possible targets, as measured by d, its VC-dimension, also effects the
difficulty of tracking the target concept.
We show that if the problem of minimizing the number of disagreements with a sample from
among concepts in a class H can be approximated to within a factor k, then there is a simple tracking
algorithm for H which can achieve a probability * of making a mistake if the target movement rate
is at most a constant times * 2 =(k(d + k) ln 1
* ), where d is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of
H. Also, we show that if H is properly PAC-learnable, then there is an efficient (randomized)
algorithm that with high probability approximately minimizes disagreements to within a factor of
7d + 1, yielding an efficient tracking algorithm for H which tolerates drift rates up to a constant
times * 2 =(d 2 ln 1
In addition, we prove complementary results for the classes of halfspaces and axis-aligned hy
perrectangles showing that the maximum rate of drift that any algorithm (even with unlimited
computational power) can tolerate is a constant times * 2 =d.

Abstract. Feature selection is a problem of choosing a subset of relevant
features. In general, only exhaustive search can bring about the optimal
subset. With a monotonic measure, exhaustive search can be avoided
without sacrificing optimality. Unfortunately, most error- or distance-based measures are not monotonic. A new measure is employed in this
work that is monotonic and fast to compute. The search for relevant
features according to this measure is guaranteed to be complete but not
exhaustive. Experiments are conducted for verification.

Abstract
Although backpropagation neural networks
generally predict better than decision trees do
for pattern classification problems, they are often regarded as black boxes, i.e., their predictions are not as interpretable as those of decision trees. This paper argues that this is because there has been no proper technique that
enables us to do so. With an algorithm that
can extract rules 1 , by drawing parallels with
those of decision trees, we show that the predictions of a network can be explained via rules extracted from it, thereby, the network can be understood. Experiments demonstrate that rules
extracted from neural networks are comparable with those of decision trees in terms of predictive accuracy, number of rules and average
number of conditions for a rule; they preserve
high predictive accuracy of original networks.

//abstract
Abstract
In order for a virtual environment to be effective as a training tool, it is not enough to
concentrate on the fidelity of the renderings and the accuracy of the simulated behaviors.
The environment should help trainees develop an understanding of the task being trained,
and should provide guidance and assistance as needed. This paper describes a system for
developing virtual environments in which pedagogical capabilities are incorporated into
autonomous agents that interact with trainees. These pedagogical agents can monitor
trainees progress and provide guidance and assistance. The agents interact with
simulations of objects in the environment, and with trainees. The paper describes the
architectural features of the environment and of the agents that permit the agents to meet
instructional objectives within the virtual environment. It also discusses how agent-based
instruction is combined with other methods of delivering instruction.

Abstract
Large-scale generation of natural language requires an
abstract meaning representation and a mechanism for
integrating immense amounts of lexical, morphological, grammatical, and conceptual knowledge. The
availability of corpus-based statistical knowledge motivates the invention of a new style of generation in
which word lattices compactly encode many possible
sentence renderings and a statistical extractor chooses
the best ones. The focus of generation thus shifts
to how word lattices can be generated from abstract
meaning representation. This paper presents a flexible
meaning representation scheme and generation mechanism. It includes an efficient generation algorithm and
grammar formalism that maps from a meaning representation to a lattice. This mapping is flexible enough
to allow meaning representation along a continuum of
semantic depth.

Abstract
In this paper, we propose a congestion control
mechanism for reliable multicast applications that
uses a small set of group members, or representatives,
to provide timely and accurate feedback on behalf of
congested subtrees of a multicast distribution tree.
Our algorithm does not need to compute round-trip
time (RTT) from all receivers to the source, nor does
it require knowledge of group membership or network
topology. Through simulations, we evaluate our algorithm with and without TCP cross traffic. This initial evaluation study shows that our algorithm takes
advantage of network bandwidth when available, yet
does not starve competing flows.

Abstract
Information gathering agents can automate the task of retrieving and integrating data
from a large number of diverse information sources. The key issue in their performance is
efficient query planning that minimizes the number of information sources used to answer
a query. Previous work on query planning has considered generating information gathering
plans solely based on compile-time analysis of the query and the models of the information
sources. We argue that at compile-time it may not be possible to generate an efficient
plan for retrieving the requested information because of the large number of possibly
relevant sources. We describe an approach that naturally extends query planning to use
run-time information to optimize queries that involve many sources. First, we describe an
algorithm for generating a discrimination matrix, which is a data structure that identifies
the information that can be sensed at run-time to optimize a query plan. Next, we describe
how the discrimination matrix is used to decide which of the possible run-time sensing
actions to perform. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach yields significant savings
(over 90% for some queries) in a real-world task.

Abstract
Semantic query optimization can dramatically speed up database query answering by
knowledge intensive reformulation. But the
problem of how to learn required semantic
rules has not previously been solved. This
paper describes an approach using an inductive learning algorithm to solve the problem. In our approach, learning is triggered
by user queries and then the system induces semantic rules from the information in
databases. The inductive learning algorithm
used in this approach can select an appropriate set of relevant attributes from a potentially huge number of attributes in real-world
databases. Experimental results demonstrate
that this approach can learn sufficient background knowledge to reformulate queries and
provide a 57 percent average performance improvement.

Abstract
One of the open problems listed in [ Rivest and

copies of L in their algorithm can be combined into one for better performance. This
paper describes an algorithm called D that
does that combination. The idea is to represent
the states of the learned model using observable
symbols as well as hidden symbols that are constructed during learning. These hidden symbols are created to reflect the distinct behaviors
of the model states. The distinct behaviors are
represented as local distinguishing experiments
(LDEs) (not to be confused with global distinguishing sequences), and these LDEs are created when the learner's prediction mismatches
the actual observation from the unknown machine. To synchronize the model with the environment, these LDEs can also be concatenated to form a homing sequence. It can
be shown that D can learn, with probability
1 ~, a model that is an *-approximation of
the unknown machine, in a number of actions

Abstract
Intelligent interaction in multi-agent domains frequently requires an agent to track other
agents' mental states: their current goals, beliefs, and intentions. Accuracy in this agent
tracking task is critically dependent on the accuracy of the tracker's (tracking agent's) model
of the trackee (tracked agent). Unfortunately, in real-world situations, model imperfections
arise due to the tracker's resource and information constraints, as well as due to trackees'
dynamic behavior modification. While such model imperfections are unavoidable, a tracker
must nonetheless attempt to be adaptive in its agent tracking. This article identifies key issues
in adaptive agent tracking and presents an approach called DEFT. At its core, DEFT is based
on discrimination-based learning. The main idea is to identify the deficiency of a model based
on tracking failures, and revise the model by using features that are critical in discriminating
successful and failed tracking episodes. Because in real-world situations the set of candidate
discriminating features is very large, DEFT relies on knowledge-based focusing to limit the
discrimination to those features that it determines were relevant in successful tracking episodes
with an autonomous explanation capability as a major source of this knowledge. This article
reports on experiments with an implementation of key aspects of DEFT in a complex synthetic
air-to-air combat domain.

Abstract
Much of the work on execution assumes that the agent
constantly senses the environment, which lets it respond
immediately to errors or unexpected events. In this paper, we argue that this purely reactive strategy is only
optimal if sensing is inexpensive, and we formulate a simple model of execution that incorporates the cost of sensing. We present an average-case analysis of this model,
which shows that in domains with high sensing cost or
low probability of error, a more `automatic' strategy -
one with long intervals between sensing can lead to
less expensive execution. The analysis also shows that
the distance to the goal has no effect on the optimal sensing interval. These results run counter to the prevailing
wisdom in the planning community, but they promise a
more balanced approach to the interleaving of execution
and sensing.

Advanced Transaction Processing in Multilevel Secure File
Stores

//abstract
Abstract
The concurrency control requirements for transaction processing in a multilevel secure file system are different from those in conventional transaction processing systems.
In particular, there is the need to coordinate transactions at different security levels
avoiding both potential timing covert channels and the starvation of transactions at
higher security levels. Suppose a transaction at a lower security level attempts to write
a data item that is being read by a transaction at a higher security level. On the one
hand, a timing covert channel arises if the transaction at the lower security level is either
delayed or aborted by the scheduler. On the other hand, the transaction at the high
security level may be subjected to an indefinite delay if it is forced to abort repeatedly.
This paper extends the classical two-phase locking mechanism to multilevel secure
file systems. The scheme presented here prevents potential timing covert channels and
avoids the abort of higher level transactions nonetheless guaranteeing serializability.
The programmer is provided with a powerful set of linguistic constructs that supports
exception handling, partial rollback and forward recovery. The proper use of these
constructs can prevent the indefinite delay in completion of a higher level transaction,
and allows the programmer to trade off starvation with transaction isolation.

Abstract
We propose a new image retrieval method based
on human perceptual clustering of color images. This
color clustering produces for each image a small set of
representative colors which captures the color properties of the image, and a small set of sizable contiguous
regions which captures the spatial/geometrical properties of the image. The proposed method outperforms
the traditional histogram and its improved methods not
only with its richer image retrieval capabilities which
cover a wider spectrum of user requirements, but also
with its powerful indexing scheme which is essential to
cater for large scale image databases.

Abstract
Introspective reasoning about a system's own
reasoning processes can form the basis for
learning to refine those reasoning processes.
The ROBBIE 1 system uses introspective reasoning to monitor the retrieval process of a
case-based planner to detect retrieval of inappropriate cases. When retrieval problems
are detected, the source of the problems is explained and the explanations are used to determine new indices to use during future case
retrieval. The goal of ROBBIE's learning is to
increase its ability to focus retrieval on relevant
cases, with the aim of simultaneously decreasing the number of candidates to consider and
increasing the likelihood that the system will be
able to successfully adapt the retrieved cases to
fit the current situation. We evaluate the benefits of the approach in light of empirical results
examining the effects of index learning in the
ROBBIE system.

Abstract
This paper deals with the problem of global stabilization of linear discrete time systems by means of
bounded feedback laws. The main result proved is an analog of one proved for the continuous time case
by the authors, and shows that such stabilization is possible if and only if the system is stabilizable
with arbitrary controls and the transition matrix has spectral radius less or equal to one. The proof
provides in principle an algorithm for the construction of such feedback laws, which can be implemented
either as cascades or as parallel connections ("single hidden layer neural networks") of simple saturation
functions.

Abstract
We suggest a scheme for a block cipher which uses only one randomly chosen permutation, F . The key, consisting of two blocks, K 1
and K 2 is used in the following way: The message block is XORed
with K 1 before applying F , and the outcome is XORed with K 2 , to
produce the cryptogram block. We show that the resulting cipher
is secure (when the permutation is random or pseudorandom). This
removes the need to store, or generate a multitude of permutations.

constraints are consistent, then there exists a distribution satisfying them which is supported by
a "small" sample space (one whose cardinality is
equal to the number of constraints). For the important case of independence constraints, where
the constraints have a certain form and are consistent with a joint distribution of n independent
random variables, a small sample space can be
constructed in polynomial time. This last result
is also useful for de-randomizing algorithms. We
demonstrate this technique by an application to
the problem of finding large independent sets in
sparse hypergraphs.

ABSTRACT
Several methods of increasing the speed and simplicity of the computation of off-axis transmission holograms are
presented, with applications to the real-time display of holographic images. A bipolar intensity approach enables a
linear summation of interference fringes, a factor of two speed increase, and the elimination of image noise caused by
object self-interference. An order of magnitude speed increase is obtained through the use of precomputed look-up
tables containing a large array of elemental interference patterns corresponding to point source contributions from
each of the possible locations in image space. Results achieved using a data-parallel supercomputer to compute
horizontal-parallax-only holographic patterns containing 6 megasamples indicate that an image comprised of 10,000
points with arbitrary brightness (grayscale) can be computed in under one second.

Abstract
Authoring is usually one of the most difficult parts in the design and implementation of hypertext and
hypermedia systems. This problem is exacerbated if the data to be presented by the system is speech,
rather than text or graphics, because of the slow and serial nature of speech. This paper provides an
overview of speech-only hypermedia, discusses the difficulties associated with authoring databases for
such a system, and explores a variety of techniques to assist in the authoring process.

ABSTRACT
This paper applies genetic programming
to the evolution of intelligent agents that
gradually build internal representations of
their surroundings for later use in
planning. The method used allows for the
creation of dynamically determined
representations that are not pre-designed
by the human creator of the system. In an
illustrative path-planning problem, evolved
programs learn a model of their world and
use this internal representation to plan
their successive actions. The results show
that the proposed method is successful in
evolving programs that solve the planning
problem and is thus a worthy basis for
further investigation.

Abstract
The information that a pattern of firing in the output layer of a feedforward
network of threshold-linear neurons conveys about the network's inputs is
considered. A replica-symmetric solution is found to be stable for all but
small amounts of noise. The region of instability depends on the contribution
of the threshold and the sparseness: for distributed pattern distributions,
the unstable region extends to higher noise variances than for very sparse
distributions, for which it is almost nonexistant.

Abstract
Indexing of cases is an important topic for Memory-Based Reasoning(MBR). One key problem is how to
assign weights to attributes of cases. Although several
weighting methods have been proposed, some methods cannot handle numeric attributes directly, so it
is necessary to discretize numeric values by classification. Furthermore, existing methods have no theoretical background, so little can be said about optimality.
We propose a new weighting method based on a statistical technique called Quantification Method II. It can
handle both numeric and symbolic attributes in the
same framework. Generated attribute weights are optimal in the sense that they maximize the ratio of variance between classes to variance of all cases. Experiments on several benchmark tests show that in many
cases, our method obtains higher accuracies than some
other weighting methods. The results also indicate
that it can distinguish relevant attributes from irrelevant ones, and can tolerate noisy data.

Abstract. This paper presents a comparative study of several methods for estimating
the true error of treestructured regression models. We evaluate these methods in the
context of regression tree pruning. Pruning is considered a key issue for obtaining
reliable treestructured models in a real world scenario. The major step of a pruning
process consists of obtaining accurate estimates of the error of alternative tree
models. We evaluate experimentally four methods for obtaining these estimates in
twelve domains. The goal of this evaluation was to characterise the performance of
the methods in the task of selecting the best possible tree among the set of trees
considered during pruning. The results of the comparison show that certain
estimators lead to poor decisions in some domains. The Cross Validation variant that
we have proposed achieved the best results on the setups we have considered.

Abstract
Recurrent neural networks readily process, recognize and generate temporal sequences. By encoding
grammatical strings as temporal sequences, recurrent neural networks can be trained to behave like deterministic sequential finite-state automata. Algorithms have been developed for extracting grammatical
rules from trained networks. Using a simple method for inserting prior knowledge (or rules) into recurrent
neural networks, we show that recurrent neural networks are able to perform rule revision. Rule revision
is performed by comparing the inserted rules with the rules in the finite-state automata extracted from
trained networks. The results from training a recurrent neural network to recognize a known non-trivial,
randomly generated regular grammar show that not only do the networks preserve correct rules but that
they are able to correct through training inserted rules which were initially incorrect. (By incorrect, we
mean that the rules were not the ones in the randomly generated grammar.)

Abstract
Recurrent neural networks have become popular models for system identification and time
series prediction. NARX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive models with eXogenous inputs) neural
network models are a popular subclass of recurrent networks and have been used in many
applications. Though embedded memory can be found in all recurrent network models, it is
particularly prominent in NARX models.
We show that using intelligent memory order selection through pruning and good initial
heuristics significantly improves the generalization and predictive performance of these nonlinear
systems on problems as diverse as grammatical inference and time series prediction.

Abstract
One of the most important aspects of any machine learning paradigm is how it scales according
to problem size and complexity. Using a task with known optimal training error, and a pre-specified
maximum number of training updates, we investigate the convergence of the backpropagation algorithm
with respect to a) the complexity of the required function approximation, b) the size of the network in
relation to the size required for an optimal solution, and c) the degree of noise in the training data. In
general, for a) the solution found is worse when the function to be approximated is more complex, for
b) oversized networks can result in lower training and generalization error in certain cases, and for c)
the use of committee or ensemble techniques can be more beneficial as the level of noise in the training
data is increased. For the experiments we performed, we do not obtain the optimal solution in any case.
We further support the observation that larger networks can produce better training and generalization
error using a face recognition example where a network with many more parameters than training points
generalizes better than smaller networks.

Abstract
World Wide Web (WWW) search engines (e.g. AltaVista, Infoseek, HotBot, etc.) have a number of
deficiencies including: periods of downtime, low coverage of the WWW, inconsistent and inefficient user
interfaces, out of date databases, poor relevancy ranking and precision, and difficulties with spamming
techniques. Meta search engines have been introduced which address some of these and other difficulties in
searching the WWW. However, current meta search engines retain some of these difficulties and may also
introduce their own problems (e.g. reduced relevance because one or more of the search engines returns results
with poor relevance). We present Inquirus, the NECI meta search engine, which addresses many of the
deficiencies in current techniques. Rather than working with the list of documents and summaries returned by
search engines, as current meta search engines typically do, the Inquirus meta search engine works by
downloading and analyzing the individual documents. The Inquirus meta search engine makes improvements
over existing search engines in a number of areas, e.g.: more useful document summaries incorporating query
term context, identification of both pages which no longer exist and pages which no longer contain the query
terms, advanced detection of duplicate pages, improved document ranking using proximity information,
dramatically improved precision for certain queries by using specific expressive forms, and quick jump links
and highlighting when viewing the full documents.

Abstract
This paper shows that members of the fourier transform family are the only linear
transforms that have a convolution theorem, that is, that can replace O(N 2 ) operations
of a convolution in a time domain by O(N) operations in a transform domain. Generally,
there is an additional cost to compute the transform itself. Our observation is motivated by
recent activity in wavelet and subband decompositions and related spectral analyses, which
are attractive alternatives for signal compression applications. A natural question when
using such techniques is to determine if convolutions of N -point signals can be calculated
with fewer operations in a compressed transform domain than in an uncompressed time
domain. The answer is negative for a broad set of assumptions. This paper indicates what
assumptions must be relaxed in seeking a linear transform that has a convolution theorem
comparable to the convolution theorem for fourier transforms.

Scheduling To Minimize Average Completion Time:
Off-line and On-line Algorithms
//author
Leslie A. Hall David B. Shmoys Joel Wein
//abstract
Abstract
Time-indexed linear programming formulations have recently received a great deal of attention for their practical
effectiveness in solving a number of single-machine scheduling problems. We show that these formulations are also an
important tool in the design of approximation algorithms
with good worst-case performance guarantees. We give simple new rounding techniques to convert an optimal fractional
solution into a feasible schedule for which we can prove a
constant-factor performance guarantee, thereby giving the
first theoretical evidence of the strength of these relaxations.
Specifically, we consider the problem of minimizing the
total weighted job completion time on a single machine
subject to precedence constraints, and give a polynomial-time (4 + *)-approximation algorithm, for any * &gt; 0;
the best previously known guarantee for this problem was
superlogarithmic. With somewhat larger constants, we also
show how to extend this result to the case with release date
constraints, and still more generally, to the case with m
identical parallel machines. We give two other techniques for
problems in which there are release dates, but no precedence
constraints: the first is based on other new LP rounding
algorithms, whereas the second is a general framework for
designing on-line algorithms to minimize the total weighted
completion time.

Abstract
The Hamiltonian dynamics of spherically symmetric massive thin shells
in the general relativity is considered. Two different constraint dynamical
systems representing this dynamics have been described recently; the relation
of these two systems is investigated. The symmetry groups of both systems
are found. The systems are reduced to the presymplectic manifolds 1 and 2 ,
lest non-physical aspects like gauge fixings or embeddings in extended phase
spaces hinder the argument. The following facts are shown. 1 is three- and 2
is five-dimensional; the description of the shell dynamics by 1 is incomplete
so that some measurable properties of the shell cannot be predicted. 1 is
locally equivalent to a subsystem of 2 and the corresponding local morphisms
are not unique, due to the large symmetry group of 2 . The local equivalence
explains why the same radial equation results from both systems; what is,
however, the physical importance of just local, but not global equivalence of
constraint dynamical systems remains unclear.

In this brief contribution we present the three principal laser remote

clouds and of the suspended aerosols (extinction and backscatter) in the
lower atmosphere, namely in the 0-7 km altitude region. The three lidar
techniques include the elastic ( Klett inversion, Doppler broadening) and
the nonelastic backscattering techniques ( Raman scattering). We report
on the potential of these techniques, as well as on the typical accuracies
of these techniques in the retrieval of the cloud and aerosol extinction
and backscatter vertical profiles in the troposphere (0-7 km ASL).

Abstract
We present computer simulations of a model of the brain
mechanisms operating in short-term memory tasks that are
consistent with the anatomy and physiology of prefrontal
cortex and associated subcortical structures. These
simulations include dynamical processes in thalamo-cortical loops which are used to generate short-term
persistent responses in prefrontal cortex. We discuss this
model in terms of the representation of input stimuli in
cortical association areas and prefrontal short-term
memory areas. We report on interference phenomena that
result from the interaction of these dynamical processes
and lateral projections within cortical columns. These
interference phenomena can be used to elucidate the
representational organization of short-term memory.

//abstract
Abstract
We develop necessary conditions for the development of asynchronous distributed
software that will perform uniform actions (events that if performed by any process,
must be performed at all processes). The paper focuses on dynamic uniformity, which
differs from the classical problems in that processes continually leave and join the
ongoing computation. Here, we first treat a static version of the problem (lacking joins),
and then extend the results so obtained to also include joins. Our results demonstrate
that in contrast to Consensus, which cannot be solved in asynchronous systems with
even a single faulty process, dynamic uniformity can be solved using a failure detection
mechanism that makes bounded numbers of mistakes. Because dynamic uniformity
arises in systems that maintain safety within a "primary partition" of a network, our
paper provides a rigorous characterization of the framework upon which several existing
distributed programming environments are based.

On the Boosting Ability of Top-Down
Decision Tree Learning Algorithms

Abstract
We analyze the performance of top-down algorithms for decision tree learning, such as those employed
by the widely used C4.5 and CART software packages. Our main result is a proof that such algorithms
are boosting algorithms. By this we mean that if the functions that label the internal nodes of the
decision tree can weakly approximate the unknown target function, then the top-down algorithms we
study will amplify this weak advantage to build a tree achieving any desired level of accuracy. The bounds
we obtain for this amplification show an interesting dependence on the splitting criterion used by the
top-down algorithm. More precisely, if the functions used to label the internal nodes have error 1=2
as approximations to the target function, then for the splitting criteria used by CART and C4.5, trees
of size (1=*) O(1= 2 * 2 ) and (1=*) O(log(1=*)= 2 ) (respectively) suffice to drive the error below *. Thus (for
example), a small constant advantage over random guessing is amplified to any larger constant advantage
with trees of constant size. For a new splitting criterion suggested by our analysis, the much stronger
bound of (1=*) O(1= 2 ) (which is polynomial in 1=*) is obtained, which is provably optimal for decision
tree algorithms. The differing bounds have a natural explanation in terms of concavity properties of the
splitting criterion.
The primary contribution of this work is in proving that some popular and empirically successful
heuristics that are based on first principles meet the criteria of an independently motivated theoretical
model.

Abstract
This paper re-examines the problem of parameter estimation in Bayesian networks with missing values and
hidden variables from the perspective of recent work in
on-line learning [12]. We provide a unified framework
for parameter estimation that encompasses both on-line
learning, where the model is continuously adapted to new
data cases as they arrive, and the more traditional batch
learning, where a pre-accumulated set of samples is used
in a one-time model selection process. In the batch case,
our framework encompasses both the gradient projection
algorithm [2, 3] and the EM algorithm [14] for Bayesian
networks. The framework also leads to new on-line and
batch parameter update schemes, including a parameterized version of EM. We provide both empirical and theoretical results indicating that parameterized EM allows
faster convergence to the maximum likelihood parame
ters than does standard EM.

Abstract
In recent years, networks with media rates of 100 Mbit/second or more have become widely available (FDDI, ATM,
HIPPI, ..). However, many computer systems cannot make use of the available bandwidth because of the high
overhead associated with network communication. In this paper we review the operations involved in communication over high-speed networks, and we describe optimizations of the network interface that improve network
throughput. We also discuss how the payoff of the optimizations is influenced by features of the host software and
architecture. This paper is based on our experience with the interfaces for the Nectar and Gigabit Nectar networks.

Abstract
The use of primary effects of operators is an effective approach to improving the
efficiency of planning. The characterization of "good" primary effects, however, has
remained at an informal level and there have been no algorithms for selecting primary
effects of operators.
We formalize the use of primary effects in planning and present a criterion for
selecting useful primary effects, which guarantees efficiency and completeness. We
analyze the efficiency of planning with primary effects and the quality of the resulting
plans.
We then describe a learning algorithm that automatically selects primary effects
and demonstrate, both analytically and empirically, that the use of this algorithm
significantly reduces planning time and does not compromise completeness.

Abstract
In recent years, researchers have been dedicated to the
study of underactuated manipulators which have more
joints than control actuators. In previous works,
assumptions were made as to the existence of enough
dynamic coupling between the active and the passive
joints of the manipulator for it to be possible to control
the position of the passive joints via the dynamic
coupling. In this work, the authors aim to develop an
index to measure the dynamic coupling, so as to address
when control of the underactuated system is possible,
and how the motion and robot configuration can be
designed. We discuss extensively the nature of the
dynamic coupling and of the proposed coupling index,
and their applications in the analysis and design of
underactuated systems, and in control and planning of
robot motion configuration.

Region Inference is a technique for inferring lifetimes of values in strict, higher-order programming languages such as Standard ML. The purpose of this paper is to show how ideas
from Milner's polymorphic type discipline can serve as a basis for region inference, even in the

Abstract
We present the spine calculus S !ffi&&gt; as an efficient representation for the linear -calculus !ffi&&gt;
which includes intuitionistic functions (!), linear functions (ffi), additive pairing (&), and additive unit
(&gt;). S !ffi&&gt; enhances the representation of Church's simply typed -calculus as abstract Bohm trees
by enforcing extensionality and by incorporating linear constructs. This approach permits procedures
such as unification to retain the efficient head access that characterizes first-order term languages without
the overhead of performing -conversions at run time. Potential applications lie in proof search, logic
programming, and logical frameworks based on linear type theories. We define the spine calculus, give
translations of !ffi&&gt; into S !ffi&&gt; and vice-versa, prove their soundness and completeness with respect
to typing and reductions, and show that the spine calculus is strongly normalizing and admits unique
canonical forms.

Abstract
Gesture-Based Programming is a new paradigm to ease
the burden of programming robots. By tapping in to the
users wealth of experience with contact transitions,
compliance, uncertainty and operations sequencing, we
hope to provide a more intuitive programming environment
for complex, real-world tasks based on the expressiveness
of non-verbal communication. A requirement for this to be
accomplished is the ability to interpret gestures to infer the
intentions behind them. As a first step toward this goal, this
paper presents an application of distributed perception for
inferring a users intentions by observing tactile gestures.
These gestures consist of sparse, inexact, physical
nudges applied to the robots end effector for the
purpose of modifying its trajectory in free space. A set of
independent agents - each with its own local, fuzzified,
heuristic model of a particular trajectory parameter -
observes data from a wrist force/torque sensor to evaluate
the gestures. The agents then independently determine the
confidence of their respective findings and distributed
arbitration resolves the interpretation through voting.

Abstract
This paper addresses the estimation of moving object trajectories within a geospatial coordinate system,
using a network of video sensors. A high-resolution
(0.5m grid spacing) digital elevation map (DEM) has
been constructed using a helicopter-based laser range-finder. Object locations are estimated by intersecting viewing rays from a calibrated sensor platform
with the DEM. Continuous object trajectories can then
be assembled from sequences of single-frame location
estimates using spatio-temporal filtering and domain
knowledge.

Abstract
We describe the design and implementation of a compiler that automatically translates ordinary
programs written in a subset of ML into code that generates native code at run time. Run-time
code generation can make use of values and invariants that cannot be exploited at compile time,
yielding code that is superior to statically optimal code. But the cost of optimizing and generating
code at run time can be prohibitive. We demonstrate how compile-time specialization can reduce
the cost of run-time code generation by an order of magnitude without greatly affecting code
quality. Several benchmark programs are examined, which exhibit an average cost of six cycles per
instruction generated at run time.

Abstract. The interface specification of a procedure describes the procedure's
behavior using pre- and postconditions. These pre- and postconditions are written using various functions. If some of these functions are partial, or underspec-ified, then the procedure specification may not be well-defined.
We show how to write pre- and postcondition specifications that avoid such
problems, by having the precondition "protect" the postcondition from the effects
of partiality and underspecification. We formalize the notion of protection from
partiality in the context of specification languages like VDM-SL and COLD-K.
We also formalize the notion of protection from underspecification for the Larch
family of specification languages, and for Larch show how one can prove that a
procedure specification is protected from the effects of underspecification.

Abstract:
Software architects use a number of commonly-recognized styles
to guide their design of system structures. Each of these is appropriate for
some classes of problems, but none is suitable for all problems. How, then,
does a software designer choose an architecture suitable for the problem at
hand? Two kinds of information are required: (1)
careful discrimination
among
the candidate architectures and (2)
design guidance
on how to make
appropriate choices. Here we support
careful discrimination
with a
preliminary classification of styles. We use a two-dimensional classification
strategy with control and data issues as the dominant organizing axes. We
position the major styles within this space and use finer-grained
discriminations to elaborate variations on the styles. This provides a
framework for organizing
design guidance
, which we partially flesh out with
rules of thumb.

Abstract
This paper presents two strategies for reducing the impact force resulting from the collision of a
kinematically redundant manipulator with its environment, where it is assumed that the impact
event has some finite duration. The first, an impact control strategy, involves adding torques to the
joints of the redundant manipulator to impede motion into the environment with which it is colliding. The second, an impact planning strategy, involves choosing the configuration best suited for
minimizing the impact force from an impact event, the approximate location of which is known
ahead of time. Simulated results from both strategies are presented and discussed, and it is shown
that both are successful in minimizing the impact force resulting from planned and unplanned collisions.

ABSTRACT
Digital interactive media augments interactive computing with video, audio, computer graphics and text,
allowing multimedia presentations to be individually and dynamically tailored to the user. Multimedia, and
particularly continuous media pose interesting problems for system designers, including those of latency
and synchronization. These problems are especially evident when multimedia data is remote and must be
accessed via networks. Latency and synchronization issues are discussed, and an integrated system,
Tactus, is described. Tactus facilitates the implementation of interactive multimedia computer programs by
managing latency and synchronization in the framework of an object-oriented graphical user interface
toolkit.

A Whole Sentence
Maximum Entropy Language Model

//abstract
Abstract We introduce a new kind of language model, which models whole sentences or utterances directly using the Maximum Entropy
paradigm. The new model is conceptually simpler, and more naturally
suited to modeling whole-sentence phenomena, than the conditional ME
models proposed to date. By avoiding the chain rule, the model treats
each sentence or utterance as a "bag of features", where features are
arbitrary computable properties of the sentence. The model is unnor-malizable, but this does not interfere with training (done via sampling)
or with use. Using the model is computationally straightforward. The
main computational cost of training the model is in generating sample
sentences from a Gibbs distribution. Interestingly, this cost has different dependencies, and is potentially lower, than in the comparable
conditional ME model.

Abstract
The large latency of memory accesses is a major obstacle in obtaining high processor utilization in large
scale shared-memory multiprocessors. Although the provision of coherent caches in many recent machines
has alleviated the problem somewhat, cache misses still occur frequently enough that they significantly lower
performance. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of non-binding software-controlled prefetching, as
proposed in the Stanford DASH Multiprocessor, to address this problem. The prefetches are non-binding in
the sense that the prefetched data is brought to a cache close to the processor, but is still available to the cache
coherence protocol to keep it consistent. Prefetching is software-controlled since the program must explicitly
issue prefetch instructions.
The paper presents results from detailed simulation studies done in the context of the Stanford DASH
multiprocessor. Our results show that for applications with regular data access patterns|we evaluate a particle-based simulator used in aeronautics and an LU-decomposition application|prefetching can be very effective.
It was easy to augment the applications to do prefetching and it increased their performance by 100-150% when
we prefetched directly into the processor's cache. However, for applications with complex data usage patterns,
prefetching was less successful. After much effort, the performance of a distributed-time logic simulation
application that made extensive use of pointers and linked lists could be increased only by 30%. The paper
also evaluates the effects of various hardware optimizations such as separate prefetch issue buffers, prefetching
with exclusive ownership, lockup-free caches, and weaker memory consistency models on the performance of
prefetching.

Abstract
To maximize the benefit and minimize the overhead of software-based latency tolerance techniques,
we would like to apply them precisely to the set of
dynamic references that suffer cache misses. Unfortunately, the information provided by the state-of-the-art cache miss profiling technique (summary profiling)
is inadequate for references with intermediate miss
ratios|it results in either failing to hide latency, or
else inserting unnecessary overhead. To overcome this
problem, we propose and evaluate a new technique|
correlation profiling|which improves predictability by
correlating the caching behavior with the associated dynamic context. Our experimental results demonstrate
that roughly half of the 22 non-numeric applications
we study can potentially enjoy significant reductions
in memory stall time by exploiting at least one of the
three forms of correlation profiling we consider.

Learning Maps for Indoor Mobile Robot Navigation

//abstract
Abstract
Autonomous robots must be able to learn and maintain models of their environments.
Research on mobile robot navigation has produced two major paradigms for mapping indoor
environments: grid-based and topological. While grid-based methods produce accurate
metric maps, their complexity often prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in
large-scale indoor environments. Topological maps, on the other hand, can be used much
more efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological maps are often difficult to learn
and maintain in large-scale environments, particularly if momentary sensor data is highly
ambiguous. This paper describes an approach that integrates both paradigms: grid-based
and topological. Grid-based maps are learned using artificial neural networks and naive
Bayesian integration. Topological maps are generated on top of the grid-based maps, by
partitioning the latter into coherent regions. By combining both paradigms, the approach
presented here gains advantages from both worlds: accuracy/consistency and efficiency.
The paper gives results for autonomous exploration, mapping and operation of a mobile
robot in populated multi-room environments.

Abstract
We consider the usual Normal linear mixed model for "components of variance" from a Bayesian
viewpoint. Instead of using Gibbs sampling or other Markov Chain schemes that rely on full
conditional distributions, we propose and investigate a method for simulating from posterior distributions based on rejection sampling. The method applies with arbitrary prior distributions but
we also employ as a default reference prior a version of Jeffreys's prior based on the integrated
("restricted") likelihood. We demonstrate the ease of application and flexibility of this approach
in several familiar settings, even in the presence of unbalanced data. A program implementing the
algorithm discussed here will be available in the SAS MIXED procedure.

Abstract
A scheme to compute smoothing spline ANOVA estimates for large data sets with a (near)
tensor-product structure is proposed. Such data sets are common in spatial-temporal analysis and
image analysis. This scheme combines backfitting algorithm with iterative imputation algorithm in
order to save both computational space and time. The convergence of this algorithm and various
ways to further speed it up, such as collapsing component functions and successive over-relaxation,
are discussed. Issues related to its application in spatial-temporal analysis are discussed too. An
application to a global analysis of historical surface temperature data is described.

Uncovering Hidden Structure in Bond Futures Trading

Fei CHEN , Stephen FIGLEWSKI ,

//abstract
Abstract. This study uncovers trading styles in the transaction records of US Treasury bond futures.
It uses transaction-by-transaction data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commissions' (CFTC)
Computerized Trade Reconstruction (CTR) records. The data set consists of 30 million transaction|
the complete US T-bond futures market for 3 years. Each transaction record consists of time (by the
minute), price, volume, buy/sell, and an identifier of the specific account.
We use statistical clustering techniques to group together trades that are similar. Two sets of
assumptions have to be made: (1) What is a trade? We define a trade to begin when an account opens
a position, and to end when its position size returns to zero. We describe each trade by several trade-specific variables (e.g., length of trade, maximum position size, opening move, long or short) and several
exogenous, market-specific variables (e.g., price, volatility, trading volume). (2) What process generated
the data? We assume a mixture of Gaussians. An observed trade is interpreted as a noisy realization of
one of the mixture components. This paper assumes identity covariance matrices. Furthermore, each
trade is fully assigned to a single cluster. We compare this approach to diagonal and to full covariance
structure with probabilistic assignments.
Trade profit was held back in the clustering process. It turns out that the clusters differ significantly in their profit and risk characteristics. Using conditional distributions, we summarize features
of profitable trading styles and contrast them with losing strategies. We find that profitable styles tend
to hold trades longer, trade at higher volatility, and trade earlier in the contracts. We also show how
some clusters uncover "technical" traders. Using the information about the individual accounts, the
assignments of accounts to clusters are described by entropy, and the transitions of a given account
through clusters is modeled by a first order Markov model.

Plexus is a networking architecture that allows applications to achieve high performance with customized
protocols. Application-specific protocols are written in
a typesafe language and installed dynamically into the
operating system kernel. Because these protocols execute within the kernel, they can access the network
interface and other operating system services with low
overhead. Protocols implemented with Plexus outperform equivalent protocols implemented on conventional monolithic systems. Plexus runs in the context
of the SPIN extensible operating system.

Abstract:
ATM networks will soon be moving from the experimental stage of test-beds to a commercial state
where production networks are deployed and operated. The progress of ATM networks appears to be
at risk due to the lack of a universal, open, and efficient ATM network control platform. The emerging
Private Network to Network Interface (PNNI) standard introduces a control platform that can be used
as an internetwork and possibly as an intra-network solution. However, the current PNNI still falls short
in providing an acceptable universal solution, due to lack of performance optimizations for intra-network operation, limited functionality, and the lack of open interfaces for future functional extensions
and services.
OPENET is a common portable, open, and high-performance network control platform based on performance and functional enhancements to the PNNI standard. It is vendor-independent, scalable (in
terms of network size and volume of calls), high-performance (in terms of call processing latency and
throughput), and extensible (in terms of integrating customer-specific and value-added services).
OPENET is designed as an extension to current PNNI so it can serve as a next generation PNNI. It is
compatible with PNNI in the internetworking environment allowing large networks to be partitioned
according to natural topological or organizational boundaries rather than the artificial use of internet-work interfaces at vendor boundaries.
This report describes the OPENET architecture. The major novelties of the OPENET architecture compared to the current PNNI are: the use of native ATM switching for the dissemination of utilization
updates; lightweight call setup; take down and modification signaling; a new signaling paradigm that
better supports fast reservation and multicast services; and a rich signaling infrastructure that enables
the development of augmented services (such as mobility, directory, etc.), leveraging the existing functions of the network control platform.

Two Computer Systems Paradoxes: Serialize-to-Parallelize,
and Queuing Concurrent-Writes
//author
Rimon Orni and Uzi Vishkin
//date
September 17, 1995
//abstract
Abstract
We present and examine the following Serialize-to-Parallelize Paradox: suppose a
programmer has a parallel algorithm in mind; the programmer must serialize the algorithm, and is actually trained to suppress its parallelism, while writing code; later,
however, compilation and runtime techniques are used to reverse the results of this serialization effort and extract as much parallelism as possible. This work actually provides
examples where parallel or parallel-style code enables extracting more parallelism than
standard serial code.
The "arbitrary concurrent-write" convention is useful in parallel algorithms and programs and appears to be not too difficult to implement in hardware for serial machines.
Still, typically concurrent-writes to the same memory location in a program are implemented by queuing the write operations, thus requiring time linear in the number of
writes. We call this the Queuing Concurrent-Writes Paradox.
Assuming that providing useful, easy-to-program programming paradigms to improve the overall effectiveness of computer systems is of interest, this work is a modest
example for applying such software-driven considerations to computer architecture issues. This work may be the first to relate parallel algorithms and parallel programming
with the technology of instruction level parallelism.

Abstract
We describe an efficient method for localizing a mobile robot in an environment with landmarks. We assume that the robot can identify these landmarks
and measure their bearings relative to each other. Given such noisy input, the
algorithm estimates the robot's position and orientation with respect to the
map of the environment. The algorithm makes efficient use of our representation of the landmarks by complex numbers. The algorithm runs in time linear
in the number of landmarks. We present results of simulations and propose
how to use our method for robot navigation.

a parametric perspective using the theory of statistical estimation. A scalar measure of an
object's complexity, which is invariant under affine transformation and changes in image noise
level, is extracted from the object's Fisher information. The volume of Fisher information is
shown to provide an overall statistical measure of the object's recognizability in a particular
image, while the complexity provides an intrinsically physical measure that characterizes the
object in any image. An information-conserving method is then developed for recognizing
an object imaged in a complex scene. Here the term "information-conserving" means that
the method uses all the measured data pertinent to the object's recognizability, attains the
theoretical lower bound on estimation error for any unbiased estimate of the parameter vector
describing the object, and therefore is statistically optimal. This method is then successfully
applied to finding objects imaged in thousands of complex real-world scenes.

Abstract
We have integrated the distributed search of genetic
programming based systems with collective memory
to form a collective adaptation search method. Such a
system significantly improves search as problem complexity is increased. However, there is still considerable scope for improvement. In collective adaptation, search agents gather knowledge of their environment and deposit it in a central information repository. Process agents are then able to manipulate that
focused knowledge, exploiting the exploration of the
search agents. We examine the utility of increasing
the capabilities of the centralized process agents.

Abstract
Users of digital image libraries are often not interested in image data per se but in derived
products such as catalogs of objects of interest. Converting an image database into a usable
catalog is typically carried out manually at present. For many larger image databases the
purely manual approach is completely impractical. In this paper we describe the development
of a trainable cataloging system: the user indicates the location of the objects of interest for
a number of training images and the system learns to detect and catalog these objects in the
rest of the database. In particular we describe the application of this system to the cataloging
of small volcanoes in radar images of Venus. The volcano problem is of interest because of the
scale (30,000 images, order of 1 million detectable volcanoes), technical difficulty (the variability
of the volcanoes in appearance) and the scientific importance of the problem. The problem of
uncertain or subjective ground truth is of fundamental importance in cataloging problems of this
nature and is discussed in some detail. Experimental results are presented which quantify and
compare the detection performance of the system relative to human detection performance. The
paper concludes by discussing the limitations of the proposed system and the lessons learned of
general relevance to the development of digital image libraries.

//abstract
A new notion of refinement for UNITY programs with local variables is defined. This
notion is compositional in the following sense: programs can be refined in arbitrary contexts such that all unless and leadsto properties (i.e. temporal properties for both safety
and progress) of the composition are preserved. The refinement notion is based on preservation of a new kind of UNITY-like property that takes into account the locality of
variables. We do a small case study about registers.

//abstract
ABSTRACT Stepwise refinement of programs has proven to be a suitable
method for developing parallel and distributed programs. We examine and compare a
number of different notions of program refinement for Unity. Two of these notions are
based on execution sequences. Refinement corresponds to the reduction of the set of execution sequences, i.e. reducing the amount of nondeterminism. The other refinement
notions are based on Unity properties as introduced by Chandy and Misra. The Unity approach is to refine specifications. Although it has proven a suitable formalism for deriving
algorithms, it seems less suitable for handling implementation details. Following Sanders
and Singh, we formalize program refinement in the Unity framework as the preservation
of Unity properties. We show that Unity properties are not powerful enough to characterize execution sequences. As a consequence, the notion of property-preserving refinement
differs from the notion of reducing the set of execution sequences.

Abstract
The Internet, best known by most users as the WorldWide-Web, continues to expand at an amazing pace. We
propose a new infrastructure to harness the combined resources, such as CPU cycles or disk storage, and make them
available to everyone interested. This infrastructure has the
potential for solving parallel supercomputing applications
involving thousands of cooperating components. Our approach is based on recent advances in Internet connectivity
and the implementation of safe distributed computing embodied in languages such as Java.
We developed a prototype of a global computing infrastructure, called SuperWeb, that consists of hosts, brokers
and clients. Hosts register a fraction of their computing resources (CPU time, memory, bandwidth, disk space) with
resource brokers. Client computations are then mapped by
the broker onto the registered resources. We examine an economic model for trading computing resources, and discuss
several technical challenges associated with such a global
computing environment.
