ABSTRACT

Researchers have explored the design of ambient information
systems across a wide range of physical and screen-based media.
This work has yielded rich examples of design approaches to the
problem of presenting information about a user’s world in a way
that is not distracting, but is aesthetically pleasing, and tangible to
varying degrees. Despite these successes, accumulating theoretical
and craft knowledge has been stymied by the lack of a unified
vocabulary to describe these systems and a consequent lack of a
framework for understanding their design attributes. We argue that
this area would significantly benefit from consensus about the
design space of ambient information systems and the design
attributes that define and distinguish existing approaches. We
present a definition of ambient information systems and a
taxonomy across four design dimensions: Information Capacity,
Notification Level, Representational Fidelity, and Aesthetic
Emphasis. Our analysis has uncovered four patterns of system
design and points to unexplored regions of the design space,
which may motivate future work in the field

1. INTRODUCTION

<bodyText confidence="0.999439">
From the very first formulation of Ubiquitous Computing, the
idea of a calmer and more environmentally integrated way of
displaying information has held intuitive appeal. Weiser called this
“calm computing” [35] and described the area through an elegant
example: a small, tangible representation of information in the
world, a dangling string that would wiggle based on network
traffic. When information can be conveyed via calm changes in
the environment, users are more able to focus on their primary
work tasks while staying aware of non-critical information that

affects them. Research in this sub-domain goes by various names
including “ambient displays”, “peripheral displays”, and
“notification systems”. The breadth of the systems in these broad
categories is quite large. We seek to disentangle the terminology
used to describe and categorize the wide array of systems in order
to provide a common language for discussing research therein.
An ambient display can represent many types of data, from
stock prices, to weather forecasts, to the presence or absence of
colleagues. Maintaining awareness of co-located and distant work
and social groups has been a long-term research thread in the area
of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) [5, 8]. The
Tangible Media Group at the MIT Media Lab, directed by Ishii,
also helped shape the field of ambient computation. They coined
the term “tangible media,” citing inspiration from Weiser’s vision
[35] and from Pederson and Sokoler’s AROMA system [29] and
developed AmbientROOM [17] and Ambient Fixtures [6, 18].
These systems use ambient displays to make people aware of both
group activity and other information such as network traffic.
Recent work in Ambient Intelligence has brought techniques from
Artificial Intelligence to ambient systems, spearheaded by the
Disappearing Computer initiative of the European Union [31].
This research thrust seeks to imbue ambient systems with
contextual knowledge about the environment. The Roomware
project has resulted in smart architectural spaces that support
information conveyance (and group collaboration) [33].
Researchers have developed systems that use a multitude of
everyday objects to display information. Examples include lights
of various sorts [2, 17], sounds [25], shadows [8], artificial flowers
[18], mobiles [24], and office-décor water fountains [12, 16].
Further research has sought to use framed photographs [26] and
larger artistic pictures to represent information from the world in
an art-like manner [14, 30, 32]. There are also peripheral display
“modes” of a user’s main desktop, including screensavers like
What’s Happening [36], information bars and menus such as those
leveraged in Sideshow and Irwin [6, 22], and alternate panes, like
Apple’s Dashboard [3]. As one can see, the design space is large.
All these systems provide a rich history of system design
principles, approaches, and decisions, but accumulating theoretical
and craft knowledge has been stymied by the lack of a unified
vocabulary to define and describe these systems. In this paper we
propose a set of design choices that developers of ambient
information systems must confront to build successful and
compelling systems. First we set out a definition of an ambient
information system that is a synthesis of the varied definitions
given in published research. We hone the intuitive set of

characteristics that distinguish ambient systems from other
ubiquitous computing research systems. Next, we propose a set of
design dimensions for ambient information systems. The four
dimensions of system design elucidate the main decisions one
confronts when designing an effective ambient system. Finally, we
explore the clusters across dimensions to uncover four coherent
combinations of system designs, which work as design patterns for
the field. The results also identify new ways of combining the
design attributes to explore new possibilities for ambient
information systems

2. AMBIENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9950872">
Many different terms have been used to describe the types of
systems we discuss in this paper. Three of the most commonly
used terms are “ambient display,” “peripheral display,” and
“notification system.” But how does one differentiate these
terms? Based on general understandings, we claim that

some notification systems are not peripheral but are
instead the object of focused work and attention)
The words of researchers themselves likely best explain their
conceptions of the systems that they have built. Below, we present
germane definitional quotes

the screen into the physical environment, manifesting itself as
subtle changes in form, movement, sound, color, smell,

systems, like network traffic and weather.” [17]

information through a variety of platforms and modes in an
efficient and effective manner [21 ].
The easiest way to explain the differences between systems is
to look at the design motivations that informed them. Ambient
displays are those that have pointed aesthetic goals and present a
very small number of information elements. These systems are a
proper subset of peripheral displays, which can appear either in the
environment or on secondary or even primary computer displays.
Notification systems’ design motivation results from divided
attention situations. As such, they can be equal to a primary work
task in their attentional needs or be secondary. When notification
systems are designed to be secondary to a primary task, the
systems are appropriately defined as peripheral.
In this paper, we propose the term ambient information system
as the unit of study and define the behavioral characteristics of
such as systems as follows

• Can move from the periphery to the focus of attention and

3. PREVIOUS TAXONOMIES
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998224161290323">
A small number of research papers that describe ambient
information systems also include extended discussions of the
design dimensions that motivate and contextualize their work. The
authors provide dimensions to compare and contrast their systems
to others in order to explain their design rationales.
Matthews et al use the dimensions notification level,
transition, and abstraction to characterize systems in this space
[24]. They developed the Peripheral Display Toolkit [23] that
helps people to develop ambient information displays more easily.
Their concept of notification level means the relative importance
of a particular data stream. Transitions are the programmatic
changes to the display, based on the data. Transitions include
fading, scrolling, or animation effects. They define abstraction as
the mapping that takes a piece of numerical or ordinal data and
turns it into something that the ambient display can use, something
“more easily interpreted with less [user] attention.”
Matthews et al segregate notification level into five levels:
Ignore, Change Blind, Make Aware, Interrupt, and Demand
Attention. The gradations run from low, a system ignoring the
change in the data, to high, a system demanding attention in a way
that must also be explicitly dismissed. They propose categories of
transition: interrupt, make aware, and change blind. Finally, they
bifurcate abstraction into feature abstraction or degradation.
McCrickard et al introduce a different set of three dimensions
to classify notification systems: interruption, reaction, and
comprehension [21]. Interruption is defined psychologically,
similar to Matthews’ notion, “as an event prompting transition and
reallocation of attention focus from a [primary] task to the
notification.” Reaction is defined as the rapid response to a given
stimulus, while comprehension is the long-term notion of
remembering and sense-making
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998517">
68
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999509692307692">
McCrickard et al then plot the design space as a 3-tuple of
interaction, reaction, and comprehension (IRC). Each dimension is
assigned a rating of high (1) or low (0), creating models like 0-1-0.
They label these models with meaningful names like “Ambient
Media, 0-0-1” “Indicator, 0-1-0” and “Critical Activity Monitor,
1-1-1.” Eight models serve as the corners of a design space. The
resulting space, it should be noted, is larger than the design space
of ambient information systems as we discuss in this paper
because it contains games, secondary displays, and critical activity
monitors (which by our definition, are notification systems that are
not also peripheral systems). McCrickard also classifies a set of 14
extant systems in the design space on the three dimensions.
Both of these taxonomies deal thoroughly with interruption
and detail some of the criteria for categorizing systems along this
design dimension. We extend this analysis to other dimensions of
data representation, flexibility, and aesthetics. This more holistic
view points out design trade-offs between aesthetic emphasis and
and flexibility, and between a system’s information display style
and display capacity.
Mankoff et al proposed a set of heuristics for evaluating
ambient systems [20], which may also assist system builders. The
heuristics attempt to give guidance for the formative evaluation of
ambient systems, but they also can be viewed as high-level design
guidelines, such as “The display should be designed to give ‘just
enough’ information. Too much information cramps the display,
and too little makes the display less useful

SYSTEMS

<bodyText confidence="0.998537571428571">
Designers of ambient information systems make decisions
about how much information to display, what specific aspects to
depict, and how exactly to display it, transparently or abstractly,
on a monitor or via a decorative sculpture. We present four design
dimensions that capture the space of ambient information systems.
The dimensions can be thought of as design choices or design
questions that system builders must answer. The dimensions are

information capacity

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998565333333333">
We rank 19 research systems and three consumer ambient
information systems on each of the four axes. Each axis is divided
into 5 bands, from low to high. We place systems into groups
based on information from published conference and journal
proceedings, including images and videos of systems in use if
available. The 19 systems we chose are not intended to be an
exhaustive list of all ambient information systems in the research
literature. The 19 systems are representative of the breadth of the
field and we feel that attempting an exhaustive list, while
amplifying completeness, would not significantly alter the design
dimensions.
Research systems that we analyzed include: Bus Mobile [24],
Dangling String [35], Digital Family Portrait [26], InfoCanvas
[33], Informative Art [30], Information Percolator [16], Irwin [22],
Kandinsky [11], Kiumra [19], Lumitouch [5], Notification Collage
[14], Scope [34], Sideshow [7], Table Fountain [12], Water Lamp
[8], and What’s Happening [36]. We include three consumer
systems that fit our definition of ambient information systems,
Ambient Devices Ambient Orb [2], the My Yahoo! web portal
[27] and Apple’s Dashboard [3].
Figure 1 shows the four dimensions for our analysis, and
each of the 19 systems placed into a group along each. Thin
colored lines trace the rankings of systems on each axis, similar to
a parallel coordinates plot. Each axis has values that range from
low to high through five grades. The dimensions of notification
level and representational fidelity have more descriptive axis
labels that will be explained in detail below
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.999256">
4.1 Information Capacity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999708511627907">
Ambient information systems are created to convey
information to users—information that typically is important to a
user’s sense of wellbeing and general awareness, but not critical to
their work or personal life. Information capacity represents the
number of discrete information sources that a system can
represent. Some systems are capable of displaying a single piece
of data such as the current price of a stock index. Others can
display the value of 20 (or more) different information elements
on one screen. We rank systems from “Low” to “High” on this
design dimension.
Information elements are discrete information “nuggets”. For
example, if a system monitors campus shuttle buses, each bus is a
single nugget. If the system can represent both the time to a
location and a direction of travel, then there are two nuggets of
information for each bus that is monitored.
Information capacity makes visible the design trade-off
between space and time. A designer can increase the information
capacity of a display by increasing the space for information to be
presented or by creating a display that transitions through a set of
views over time. If a system is designed with multiple views or
uses scrolling, we rank it in the top tier, since the number of pieces
of information that it could display is arbitrarily large.
A further caveat about information capacity is necessary.
Some of the analyzed systems such as InfoCanvas, Sideshow, and
Dashboard are user-configured and user-customizable. This means
that these and other systems could potentially be made to display
hundreds of elements. Instead of attempting to calculate a
theoretical maximum throughput for the display in these cases, we
use the system designer’s naturalistic portrayal in their published
work to determine the “everyday maximum.” Each of these
systems is also in the top tier of information capacity.
The design dimension of information capacity has a barbell
distribution. Five of the 19 systems display a single information
element and are ranked “Low”. Conversely, there are eight
systems that display from ten to 20 information elements, with
some systems having the potential to display more and these are
ranked “High.” Only a few systems take a middle-ground
approach, attempting to display a small number (from two to ten)
of information elements.
The systems with low ratings on the attribute of information
conveyance are those that are physical displays. Fountains,
glowing lights, and office-decoration sculptures afford designers
only so much flexibility for changes

each system’s ranking along the design dimensions. Different colors are used to denote groups of systems which are similar as
explained more fully in Section 5.
Since the number of changes possible is small, the total number
of information nuggets that can be represented is
correspondingly small. The systems with high information
conveyance are those that are presented on LCD screens. The
systems that run at full screen (instead of as a small section of a
focused main monitor) are ranked the highest
</figureCaption>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.997487">
4.2 Notification Level
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999884302325582">
Notification level is the degree to which system alerts are
meant to interrupt a user. Notification level is a design attribute
that is present in the two taxonomies of ambient and peripheral
information systems we reviewed earlier. Matthews et al
subdivides notification level into five categories: ignore, change
blind, make aware, interrupt, and demand attention. For our
analysis we adopt those categories but replace the lowest level
of system alert function, ignore (a degenerate case) with user
poll. Systems such as Apple Dashboard and My Yahoo! do not
always appear in a user’s environment and must be explicitly
called to the fore.
Notification level can be thought of as the “ambience” of
the systems in question. Some systems in the ambient space are
quiet, and afford opportunistic glances to the information, while
others provide more strident alerts by blinking, flashing,
beeping, or even opening dialog windows. Systems that provide
unobtrusive change blind or make aware notifications to the user
are at the core of the ambient information system design space.
Systems that interrupt users with alarms or that demand
attention (by launching system dialog windows) are not subtle,
so are further from the core concept of ambient information
systems, though, as Matthews et al argues, the smooth transition
from more subtle to more jarring is an interesting design
direction for ambient system designers.
Notification level is the designer-intended level of alert.
We do not take pains to distinguish between systems that are
proven to be “change blind” through user experimentation
versus those that merely claim change blindness. We remain
agnostic here about the techniques used for ensuring subtlety
including slow animation, scrolling, and fading (these
implementation details are at a lower level of design rationale).
Once the decision has been made to produce a system with
change blind transitions, the designer must then produce system
transitions that meet the goal in the specifics of the system. Our
analysis focuses on the high level decision on the part of the
designer or design team.
The distribution of systems here shows a good fit to our
definition of ambient information systems. It is apparent that
most ambient information systems adhere to the central notion
of subtle visual or representational changes. The vast majority of
ambient information systems fall into the change blind and make
aware transition categories (somewhat low and medium). Few
systems are designed to interrupt users or demand attention

Two that do however are Scope and Sideshow. Note that most
systems that are physical displays do not have make-aware or
interruption-level alerts, much less demand attention alerts. The
Bus Mobile does enable make-aware transitions, when, for
example, the last bus of the day approaches
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998571">
4.3 Representational Fidelity
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999570781818182">
Representational fidelity describes a system’s display
components and how the data from the world is encoded into
patterns, pictures, words, or sounds. Some systems reproduce
the information being monitored in a very direct way, while
others are much more abstract in their representation. Matthews
et al’s taxonomy characterizes this design choice as abstraction,
but only distinguishes two sub-types, feature degradation and
feature abstraction. We consider this design dimension to be rich
and complex, so we will try to tease apart the many different
types of abstraction that appear in ambient information systems.
Representational fidelity can be described in the language
of Semiotics, the branch of Philosophy that deals with signs, sign
systems (such as natural languages) and their meanings. As such
it has an accepted vocabulary for the elements of a symbolic
representation. Semiotics can help analyze the way that
particular signifiers—words, pictures, sounds, and other
things—stand for the things they represent.
A semiotic sign is made up of three parts [28]. The object
is called the signified; it is the physical thing or idea that the
sign stands for. The signifier is the representation of the object,
which could be a word, a picture, or a a sound. The sense is the
understanding that an observer gets from seeing or experiencing
either the signified or its signifier. The signifier and the signified
need not have any direct relationship. However, both the
signified and the signifier create the same sense in the head of an
observer; seeing a log aflame and seeing the word “fire” create
the same meaning for a person.
Ambient information systems, in the vocabulary of
semiotics, contain one or more signs. Each sign has its object,
information in the world, and its representation, the lights,
pictures, or sounds used to signify that information. Many
ambient information systems contain multiple signs—each
picture element standing for a different piece of information.
The theory of Semiotics also helps to explain the notion
that some signs are transparent, easily understood, while others
are metaphorical and still others are abstract. Signs can be
symbolic, iconic, or indexical. Symbolic signs are those that are
completely arbitrary. For example languages are arbitrary, for
the word “bachelor” has no more natural relation to an
unmarried man than does the word “foobar. ” Symbolic signs
are those signs for which a code, or rule-following convention,
is required to understand. Language characters and numbers are
all symbolic, as are abstract visual representations (the color red
standing for “danger”). Iconic signs are those signs that have an
intermediate degree of transparency to the signified object.
Iconic signs include metaphors as well as doodles, drawings,
and caricatures. Icons represent their objects by having some
similarity or resemblance to the object or to an essential aspects
of the object. Indexical signs are those that are directly
connected to the signified. Examples include measuring
instruments, maps, and photographs.
We have subdivided the three main categories of
representational fidelity to distinguish between ambient
information systems. We propose five groups, ranked from
indexical (high) to symbolic (low
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998754666666667">
INDEXICAL: measuring instruments, maps,
photographs
• ICONIC: drawings, doodles, caricatures
• ICONIC: Metaphors
■ SYMBOLIC: language symbols (letters and numbers)
■ SYMBOLIC: abstract symbols
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99921835483871">
Some ambient information systems have displays that do
not afford representational flexibility, because of the constraints
of the display. For example, the LiveWire system and the
Ambient Orb cannot represent language symbols, nor can they
convey indexical forms like photographs. However, some
flexibility is present. The systems might map information in an
arbitrary way, remaining fully abstract (representing stock
increases with the color green and losses with the color red), or
it could map information more metaphorically, as would be the
case if LiveWire were connected to information from a
seismograph or ocean tides. As one can see, the question
concerning representational flexibility requires one to consider
both the display and the information that is displayed.
The InfoCanvas is a very flexible system when considering
representational fidelity. The InfoCanvas uses all five types of
representational fidelity. It uses abstract symbols, such as the
color red standing for traffic being stopped, metaphors, like a
cartoon drawing of a cloud representing cloudy conditions, and
also photographs and words of news stories, which are fully
indexical. We show this ability for a system to straddle multiple
representational forms by duplicating the system in each
category and noting them with an asterisk (see Figure 1).
Systems which are designed to represent information at multiple
levels of fidelity are: Apple’s Dashboard, InfoCanvas,
Informative Art, Notification Collage, Sideshow, and What’s
Happening. In these cases, we draw the parallel coordinate plot
to the top-most tier of representational fidelity for each system.
The majority of systems however, only afford a single level
of representational fidelity. Many of the sculptural displays only
afford symbolic, that is abstract, representations, while a smaller
number afford text and photographic representations
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.998876">
4.4 Aesthetic Emphasis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999812529411765">
The final dimension concerns the relative importance of the
aesthetics of the display. Some system designers seek to build
displays and artifacts with sculptural or artistic conventions. For
these systems, being visually pleasing is a primary objective.
Others however place relatively little focus on aesthetics and
typically focus more on information communication ability.
Since aesthetic judgment is at its core a subjective phenomenon,
we do not judge systems on their relative artistic merits. Instead
we attempt to rank ambient information systems by our
perception of the importance given to aesthetics. There is often a
tradeoff made between communication capacity,
representational fidelity, and aesthetics, a relationship that we
explore in this section.
Ambient information systems are intended to be visible;
positioned on a shelf, hung on the wall, or placed as a small
sculpture on a desk, the systems are seen not just by a user, but
also by co-workers, colleagues, or family members. There are a
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998451">
71
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999820358974359">
multitude of approaches when it comes to building aesthetically
pleasing devices. One approach is to build systems that mirror
existing artworks by a particular artist, as is the case in
Kandinsky and Informative Art. A second approach is to design
a display that is representative of a particular style or art
movement. InfoCanvas, through its use of themes, allows the
display to take on characteristics of Asian water-color paintings,
for example.
We rank systems on the design dimension of aesthetic
emphasis as low, somewhat low, medium, somewhat high and
high. Note again that we are not assessing the degree to which
the systems are successful as art. We are providing a subjective
measure of how much the system designers focused on
aesthetics and how much they emphasized aesthetic
considerations in their research and design decisions.
Most systems that we analyzed had medium or somewhat
high degrees of aesthetic emphasis (12 of 19). The decisions of
designers to strive for visually pleasing displays is most clear in
the cases where the display is intended to leverage the work of
existing artists. The physical ambient information displays are
often sculptural in their design decisions. They attempt to set
themselves off from the rest of the environment, often on
pedestals or stands. Their capability to display much information
(information capacity) is often limited by their design clarity and
austerity. We consider this design trade-off in the next section.
Systems that we ranked at the middle of the spectrum of
aesthetic emphasis are those which are not intended by their
designers to be art worthy of contemplation as art objects. But
they are explicitly intended to be viewed as calm pleasing
objects and displays. Apple’s Dashboard widgets have a clean
design sense about them, as does Kimura, What’s Happening
and the Information Percolator. The systems that are ranked low
on aesthetic emphasis are Scope, Sideshow, Bus Mobile, Elvin,
and My Yahoo!. These systems put information conveyance at a
higher priority than being aesthetically pleasing. They are still
calm and environmentally appropriate, but their designers did
not emphasize their aesthetic qualities. Cleary, some systems
that are early-stage prototypes like Bus Mobile, may not have
the aesthetic polish of more finished systems

5. FOUR DESIGN PATTERNS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99728275">
In this section, we introduce four design patterns for
ambient information systems, after Alexander’s pattern language
for architectural studies [1]. The design patterns illustrate four
coherent combinations of the four design dimensions previously
presented. We have already pointed out trends and clusters that
are present in each particular design dimension. However, there
are fruitful conclusions for system designers as we consider the
interaction between the design dimensions to form design
patterns.
Considering the clusters of systems in each dimension and
the correspondences that are visible in the parallel coordinate
plot, we find four main archetypes in existing ambient
information system design: Symbolic Sculptural Display,
Multiple-Information Consolidators, Information Monitor
Display, and High Throughput Textual Display. Figure 2
shows the pattern of each archetype across the dimensions

of the design space. Heavy boxes indicate core design
decisions, while light boxes show alternate choices.
Symbolic Sculptural Displays are ambient information systems
that display very few pieces of information, usually a single
element. They represent information in an abstract sculptural
way with light, water, or moving objects. They are intended to
be decorative objects for a home or office setting and as such are
highly aesthetic in their design (see Figure 2a). This design
pattern is a core of ambient system design, and accounts for six
of our analyzed systems: Ambient Orb, Dangling String, Digital
Family Portrait, Information Percolator, Lumitouch, Table
Fountain, and Water Lamp. The Digital Family Portrait
combines multiple information sources and so truly represents
more information than the other members of this type

<bodyText confidence="0.999416854166667">
Multiple Information Consolidators are ambient systems that
display many individual pieces of information in a consolidated
manner. They are typically screen-based in order to convey
much information and make users aware of changes to that
information (usually by blinking the visual representation of a
certain element). They are reasonably aesthetically motivated,
but all clearly demonstrate the trade-off between aesthetics and
customization and information capacity (see Figure 2b). Systems
which illustrate this design pattern are: Kandinsky, Kimura,
InfoCanvas, Notification Collage, and What’s Happening.
Kandinsky departs from the other systems in that it is explicitly
modeled on the fine art of Kandinsky, and as such is highly
stylized and design-focused. It does so at the expense of
flexibility, since it can only display photographs in its slots.
Information Monitor Displays are displays that are a
peripheral part of a user’s computer desktop. As such, they
afford different interactions and design choices. They display
multiple sources of information, and do so usually by visual
metaphors. They are capable of notifying users in multiple ways
about changes in the source data, including subtle awareness,
interrupting, and even demanding user attention when necessary
(i.e., requiring the user to switch focus to dismiss a notification).
The systems achieve aesthetics, but their primary purpose is not
good looks (see Figure 2c). Examples of this design archetype
include: Scope, and Sideshow.
High Throughput Textual Display systems are those that use
text and very simple graphics (icons) to denote information.
They are capable of representing voluminous information, but
do not draw attention with interruption-level notifications. These
systems are not primarily as concerned with aesthetics as they
are with information conveyance (see Figure 2d). These systems
are simple but efficient for certain types of tasks. Examples of
this design archetype are: Elvin, and My Yahoo!.
The four design archetypes cover nearly all of the analyzed
systems, but do not cleanly categorize three systems. Apple’s
Dashboard system is most similar to a Multiple Information
Consolidator. It fails being a pure example of this archetype
because of its inability to alert users to changes in information –
it requires users poll the system by calling up the transparent
pane via a hot key. The Bus Mobile is an early stage prototype,
and as such is not concerned with aesthetics to a large degree.
With a higher degree of aesthetic emphasis, it might be closer to
a Information Monitor Display (albeit a physical instead of
screen-based system). Informative Art is quite unlike the four
design archetypes. Informative Art has high aesthetic emphasis,
but low information capacity (e.g. 5 or 6 city’s weather forecast
information). It is metaphorical and abstract in its information
mapping fidelity

6. EXTENDING THE PATTERNS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99995174137931">
The four patterns for system design can help designers to
make appropriate choices as they develop new ambient
information systems. The design patterns can be used as models
so a designer can decide to build “an information monitor
display for a home health awareness application”, or “a set of
symbolic sculptural displays for work-group collaboration”.
Further, the designer may be depart from the pattern, by building
up a system’s range of possible notification levels, or by
choosing to trade aesthetics for increased information capacity.
However, our analysis also points at what has not yet been
explored. The four design patterns show four coherent
combinations, but they are not the only possibilities for building
useful ambient systems. Combined with longer-term trends in
the fields of Ambient Intelligence and Ubiquitous Computing,
new archetypes for system design are emerging. We note
possibilities here, which change both the dimensions and the
four design patterns.
We do not expect the information capacity for ambient
systems to increase by dramatically. Though scrolling or time-
divided ambient systems (What’s Happening, Elvin) can already
display data elements numbering in the hundreds, simultaneous
visual displays are usually limited to 25 or 30 elements by
readability and user learnability. Ambient information systems
will not turn into information visualization systems showing
thousands of data points. However, contextual sets of
information may be useful for ambient systems in specialized
environments. Systems which display contextual sets of
information like that of the Bus Mobile (all of the buses on a
college campus) or Scope (email and calendar data) would
increase the number of systems in the middle portion of this
design dimension.
We also expect to see changes to the design dimension of
representational flexibility. Designers have begun to explore the
affordances of abstract and symbolic mappings between
information sources and their representations. We see this
continuing, with new systems focusing on personally relevant
symbolic representations, and utilizing metaphors from the
natural and built worlds. Another shift that we foresee is the
designers creating systems where multiple information sources
and aspects interact to affect a single part of the representation.
This is apparent already in Digital Family Portrait where the size
of the butterflies represents “activity,” even though activity is
not the reading from a single sensor, but it instead a reading
from multiple sensors in a home. Informative Art also has
aspects of this approach, changing both the color and
dimensions of squares based on two different aspects of weather.
As regards aesthetic emphasis, we foresee a more radical
change. We predict further exploration of the space of truly
artistically motivated ambient information systems. These
generative artworks use information from the world to drive
their behavior and ask (and answer) art questions as well as
technology questions. Though most of these works are outside
the academy (they are shown in galleries instead of computer
science conferences), Bolen and Mateas’ Office Plant #1 [4] is a
sculpture that characterizes the mood of a user’s email stream
and conveys it via transformations of a robotic plant. These
systems are going to create a new design space above the top tier
that we depict in this work

7. CONCLUSIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999944384615385">
In this work we synthesize a definition that distinguishes
research in ambient information systems from that of
notification systems and peripheral displays. We propose four
design dimensions, rank systems to show clusters, and uncover
four design patterns on which system developers may model
their system designs. Future work will expand the four
dimensions to include aspects of the social interaction and
impact that system have on the behavior of individuals and
groups.
In this work we point toward open areas in the design
space, and we point to new design directions that may fill these
gaps. Future work may also turn this taxonomy into an
evaluation framework for ambient information systems
