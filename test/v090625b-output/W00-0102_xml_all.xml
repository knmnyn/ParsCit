Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999594636363636">
We propose a method for dealing with
semantic complexities occurring in
information retrieval systems on the basis of
linguistic observations. Our method follows
from an analysis indicating that long runs of
content words appear in a stopped document
cluster, and our observation that these long
runs predominately originate from the
prepositional phrase and subject
complement positions and as such, may be
useful predictors of semantic coherence.
From this linguistic basis, we test three
statistical hypotheses over a small collection
of documents from different genre. By
coordinating thesaurus semantic categories
(SEMCATs) of the long run words to the
semantic categories of paragraphs, we
conclude that for paragraphs containing both
long runs and short runs, the SEMCAT
weight of long runs of content words is a
strong predictor of the semantic coherence
of the paragraph.

Introduction
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998586378378378">
One of the fundamental deficiencies of current
information retrieval methods is that the words
searchers use to construct terms often are not the
same as those by which the searched information
has been indexed. There are two components to
this problem, synonymy and polysemy
(Deerwester et. al., 1990). By definition of
polysemy, a document containing the search
terms or indexed with the search terms is not
necessarily relevant. Polysemy contributes
heavily to poor precision. Attempts to deal with
the synonymy problem have relied on
intellectual or automatic term expansion, or the
construction of a thesaurus.
Also the ambiguity of natural language causes
semantic complexities that result in poor
precision. Since queries are mostly formulated
as words or phrases in a language, and the
expressions of a language are ambiguous in
many cases, the system must have ways to
disambiguate the query.
In order to resolve semantic complexities in
information retrieval systems, we designed a
method to incorporate semantic information into
current IR systems. Our method ( 1 ) adopts
widely used Semantic Information or
Categories, (2) calculates Semantic Weight
based on probability, and (3) (for the purpose of
verifying the method) performs partial text
retrieval based upon Semantic Weight or
Coherence to overcome cognitive overload of
the human agent. We make two basic
assumptions: 1. Matching search terms to
semantic categories should improve retrieval
precision. 2. Long runs of content words have a
linguistic basis for Semantic Weight and can
also be verified statistically.

<bodyText confidence="0.999471111111111">
There have been several attempts to deal with
complexity using semantic information. These
methods are hampered by the lack of
dictionaries containing proper semantic
categories for classifying text. Semantic
methods designed by Boyd et. al. (1994) and
Wendlandt et. al. (1991) demonstrate only
simple examples and are restricted to small
numbers of words. In order to overcome this

deficiency, we propose to incorporate the
structural information of the thesaurus, semantic
categories (SEMCATs). However, we must also
incorporate semantic categories into current IR
systems in a compatible manner. The problem
we deal with is partial text retrieval when all the
terms of the traditional vector equations are not
known. This is the case when retrieval is
associated with a near real time filter, or when
the size or number of documents in a corpus is
unknown. In such cases we can retrieve only
partial text, a paragraph or page. But since there
is no document wide or corpus wide statistics, it
is difficult to judge whether or not the text
fragment is relevant. The method we employ in
this paper identifies semantic &amp;quot;hot spots&amp;quot; in
partial text. These &amp;quot;hot spots&amp;quot; are loci of
semantic coherence in a paragraph of text. Such
paragraphs are likely to convey the central ideas
of the document,
We also deal with the computational aspects
of partial text retrieval. We use a simple
stop/stem method to expose long runs of context
words that are evaluated relative to the search
terms. Our goal is not to retrieve a highly
relevant sentence, but rather to retrieve a portion
of text that is semantically coherent with respect
to the search terms. This locale can be returned
to the searcher for evaluation and if it is
relevant, the search terms can be refined. This
approach is compatible with Latent Semantic
Indexing (LSI) for partial text retrieval when the
terms of the vector space are not known. LSI is
based on a vector space information retrieval
method that has demonstrated improved
performance over the traditional vector space
techniques. So when incorporating semantic
information, it is necessary to adopt existing
mathematical methods including probabilistic
methods and statistical methods.

<subsectionHeader confidence="0.944627">
2.1 Long Runs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996833714285715">
Partial Information Retrieval has to with
detection of main ideas. Main ideas are topic
sentences that have central meaning to the text.
Our method of detecting main idea paragraphs
extends from Jang (1997) who observed that
after stemming and stopping a document, long
runs of content words cluster. Content word runs
are a sequence of content words with a function
word(s) prefix and suffix. These runs can be
weighted for density in a stopped document and
vector processed. We observed that these long
content word runs generally originate from the
prepositional phrase and subject complement
positions, providing a linguistic basis for a dense
neighbourhood of long runs of content words
signalling a semantic locus of the writing. We
suppose that these neighbourhoods may contain
main ideas of the text. In order to verify this, we
designed a methodology to incorporate semantic
features into information retrieval and examined
long runs of content words as a semantic
predictor.
We examined all the long runs of the Jang
(1997) collection and discovered most of them
originate from the prepositional phrase and
subject complement positions. According to
Halliday (1985), a preposition is explained as a
minor verb. It functions as a minor Predicator
having a nominal group as its complement. Thus
the internal structure of &amp;apos;across the lake&amp;apos; is like
that of &amp;apos;crossing the lake&amp;apos;, with a non-finite
verb as Predicator (thus our choice of 3 words
as a long run). When we interpret the
preposition as a &amp;quot;minor Predicator&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;minor
Process&amp;quot;, we are interpreting the prepositional
phrase as a kind of minor clause. That is,
prepositional phrases function as a clause and
their role is predication.
Traditionally, predication is what a statement
says about its subject. A named predication
corresponds to an externally defined function,
namely what the speaker intends to say his or
her subject, i.e. their referent. If long runs
largely appear in predication positions, it would
suggest that the speaker is saying something
important and the longer runs of content words
would signal a locus of the speaker&amp;apos;s intention.
Extending from the statistical analysis of Jang
(1997) and our observations of those long runs
in the collection, we give a basic assumption of
OUT study:
Long runs of content words contain
significant semantic information that a
speaker wants to express and focus,
and thus are semantic indicators or loci
or main ideas.

In this paper, we examine the SEMCAT

random document of the collection in Jang
(1997), to determine if the SEMCAT weights of
long runs of content words are semantic
predictors.

We adopted Roget&amp;apos;s Thesaurus for our basic
semantic categories (SEMCATs). We extracted
the semantic categories from the online
Thesaurus for convenience. We employ the 39
intermediate categories as basic semantic
information, since the 6 main categories are too
general, and the many sub-categories are too
narrow to be taken into account. We refer to
these 39 categories as SEMCATs.

2.3 Indexing Space and Stop Lists
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999777761904762">
Many of the most frequently occurring words in
English, such as &amp;quot;the,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;of,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;and,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;to,&amp;quot; etc. are
non-discriminators with respect to information
filtering. Since many of these function words
make up a large fraction of the text of Most
documents, their early elimination in the
indexing process speeds processing, saves
significant amounts of index space and does not
compromise the filtering process. In the Brown
Corpus, the frequency of stop words is 551,057
out of 1,013,644 total words. Function words
therefore account for about 54.5% of the tokens
in a document.
The Brown Corpus is useful in text retrieval
because it is small and efficiently exposes
content word runs. Furthermore, minimizing the
document token size is very important in NLP-
based methods, because NLP-based methods
usually need much larger indexing spaces than
statistical-based methods due to processes for
tagging and parsing.

The traditional vector processing model
requires the following set of terms:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.997704625">
• (dl) the number of documents in the
collection that each word occurs in
• (id° the inverse document frequency of each

• The category probability of each query

word.
Wendlandt (1991) points out that it is useful to
retrieve a set of documents based upon key
words only, and then considers only those
documents for semantic category and attribute
analysis. Wendlandt (1991) appends the s
category weights to the t term weights of each
document vector Di and the Query vector Q.
Since our basic query unit is a paragraph,
document frequency (dl) and inverse document
frequency (idf) have to be redefined. As we
pointed out in Section 1, all terms are not known
in partial text retrieval. Further, our approach is
based on semantic weight rather than word
frequency. Therefore any frequency based
measures defined by Boyd et al. (1994) and
Wendlandt (1991) need to be built from the
probabilities of individual semantic categories.
Those modifications are described below. As a
simplifying assumption, we assume SEMCATs
have a uniform probability distribution with
regard to a word.

3.2 Calculating SEMCATs
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.921537423076923">
Our first task in computing SEMCAT values
was to create a SEMCAT dictionary for our
method. We extracted SEMCATs for every
word from the World Wide Web version of
Roget&amp;apos;s thesaurus. SEMCATs give probabilities
of a word corresponding to a semantic category.
The content word run &amp;apos;favorite companion
detractors love&amp;apos; is of length 4. Each word of the
run maps to at least one SEMCAT. The word
`favorite&amp;apos; maps to categories `PEAF and SYAF&amp;apos;.
&amp;apos;companion&amp;apos; maps to categories &amp;apos;ANT, MECO,
NUM, ORD, ORGM, PEAF, PRVO, QUAN,
and SYAF&amp;apos;. &amp;apos;detractor&amp;apos; maps to `MOAF&amp;apos;. &amp;apos;love&amp;apos;
maps to `AFIG, ANT, MECO, MOAF, MOCO,
ORGM, PEAF, PORE, PRVO, SYAF, and
VOIG&amp;apos;. We treat the long runs as a semantic
core from which to calculate SEMCAT values.
SEMCAT weights are calculated based on the
following equations.
Eq.1 Pik(Probability) - The likelihood of
SEMCAT Si occurring due to the le
trigger. For example, assuming a
uniform probability distribution, the
category PEAF triggered by the word
favorite above, has the following

In every paragraph, extraction of SEMCATs

Swxidw. The final, total relevance weights are
an accumulation of all weights of SEMCATs of
content words in a paragraph. Total relevance
tells how many SEMCATs of the Query&amp;apos;s long
runs appear in a paragraph. Higher values imply
that the paragraph is relevant to the long runs of
the Query.

4 Experimental Results
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999767826086957">
The goal of employing probability and vector
processing is to prove the linguistic basis that
long runs of content words can be used as
predictors of semantic intent But we also want to
exploit the computational advantage of
removing the function words from the
document, which reduces the number of tokens
processed by about 50% and thus reduces vector
space and probability computations. If it is true
that long runs of content words are predictors of
semantic coherence, we can further reduce the
complexity of vector computations: (1) by
eliminating those paragraphs without long runs
from consideration, (2) within remaining
paragraphs with long runs, computing and
summing the semantic coherence of the longest
runs only, (3) ranking the eligible paragraphs for
retrieval based upon their semantic weights
relative to the query.
Jang (1997) established that the distribution
of long runs of content words and short runs of
content words in a collection of paragraphs are
drawn from different populations. This implies
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998885">
10
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.992079333333333">
that either long runs or short runs are predictors,
but since all paragraphs contain short runs, i.e. a
single content word separated by function
words, only long runs can be useful predictors.
Furthermore, only long runs as we define them
can be used as predictors because short runs are
insufficient to construct the language constructs
for prepositional phrase and subject complement
positions. If short runs were discriminators, the
linguistic assumption of this research would be
violated. The statistical analysis of Jang (1997)
does not indicate this to be the case.
To proceed in establishing the viability of
our approach, we proposed the following
experimental hypotheses:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9884992">
(111) The SEMCAT weights for long runs
of content words are statistically greater
than weights for short runs of content
words. Since each content word can map
to multiple SEMCATs, we cannot
assume that the semantic weight of a
long run is a function of its length. The
semantic coherence of long runs should
be a more granular discriminator.
(112) For paragraphs containing long runs
and short runs, the distribution of long
run SEMCAT weights is statistically
different from the distribution of short
run SEMCAT weights.
(H3) There is a positive correlation

<bodyText confidence="0.988741666666667">
between the sum of long run SEMCAT
weights and the semantic coherence of a
paragraph, the total paragraph SEMCAT
weight.

and their outcome are described in Shin (1997,
1999). The results of the experiments and the
implications of those results relative to the
method we propose are discussed below. Table 3

<bodyText confidence="0.9984884">
This research tested three statistical hypotheses
extending from two observations: (1) fang
(1997) observed the clustering of long runs of
content words and established the distribution of
long run lengths and short run lengths are drawn
from different populations, (2) our observation
that these long runs of content words originate
from the prepositional phrase and subject
complement positions. According to Halliday
(1985) those grammar structures function as

minor predication and as such are loci of
semantic intent or coherence. In order to
facilitate the use of long runs as predictors, we
modified the traditional measures of Boyd et al.
(1994), Wendlandt (1991) to accommodate
semantic categories and partial text retrieval.
The revised metrics and the computational
method we propose were used in the statistical
experiments presented above. The main findings
of this work are
1. the distribution semantic coherence
(SEMCAT weights) of long runs is not
statistically greater than that of short
runs,
2. for paragraphs containing both long runs
and short runs, the SEMCAT weight
distributions are drawn from different
populations
3. there is a positive correlation between
the sum of long run SEMCAT weights
and the total SEMCAT weight of the
paragraph (its semantic coherence).
Significant additional work is required to
validate these preliminary results. The collection
employed in Jang (1997) is not a standard
Corpus so we have no way to test precision and
relevance of the proposed method. The results of
the proposed method are subject to the accuracy
of the stop lists and filtering function.
Nonetheless, we feel the approach proposed
has potential to improve performance through
reduced token processing and increased
relevance through consideration of semantic
coherence of long runs. Significantly, our
approach does not require knowledge of the
collection.

<abstract confidence="0.999518956521739">We propose a method for dealing with semantic complexities occurring in information retrieval systems on the basis of linguistic observations. Our method follows from an analysis indicating that long runs of content words appear in a stopped document cluster, and our observation that these long runs predominately originate from the prepositional phrase and subject complement positions and as such, may be useful predictors of semantic coherence. From this linguistic basis, we test three statistical hypotheses over a small collection of documents from different genre. By coordinating thesaurus semantic categories (SEMCATs) of the long run words to the semantic categories of paragraphs, we conclude that for paragraphs containing both long runs and short runs, the SEMCAT weight of long runs of content words is a strong predictor of the semantic coherence of the paragraph</abstract>
