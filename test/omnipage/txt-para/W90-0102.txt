Abstract
# Para 8 14
Tree-adjoining grammars (TAG) have been proposed as 
a formalism for generation based on the intuition that 
the extended domain of syntactic locality that TAGs 
provide should aid in localizing semantic dependencies 
as well, in turn serving as an aid to generation from 
semantic representations. We demonstrate that this 
intuition can be made concrete by using the formal-
ism of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars. The use 
of synchronous TAGs for generation provides solutions 
to several problems with previous approaches to TAG 
generation. Furthermore, the semantic monotonicity 
requirement previously advocated for generation gram-
mars as a computational aid is seen to be an inherent 
property of synchronous TAGs.
# Para 22 1
Introduction
# Para 23 18
The recent history of grammar reversing can be viewed 
as an effort to recover some notion of semantic local-
ity on which to base a generation process. For in-
stance, Wedekind (1988) requires a property of a gram-
mar that he refers to as connectedness, which spec-
ifies that complements be semantically connected to 
their head. Shieber (1988) defines a notion of semantic 
monotonicity, a kind of compositionality property that 
guarantees that it can be locally determined whether 
phrases can contribute to forming an expression with 
a given meaning. Generation schemes that reorder 
top-down generation (Dymetman and Isabelle, 1988; 
Strzalkowski, 1989) so as to make available information 
that well-founds the top-down recursion also fall into 
the mold of localizing semantic information. Semantic-
head-driven generation (Shieber et al., forthcoming; 
Calder et al., 1989) uses semantic heads and their com-
plements as a locus of semantic locality.
# Para 41 7
Joshi (1987) points out that tree-adjoining grammars 
may be an especially appropriate formalism for gen-
eration because of their syntactic locality properties, 
which, intuitively at least, ought to correlate with some 
notion of semantic locality. The same observation runs 
as an undercurrent in the work of McDonald and Puste-
jovsky (1985), who apply TAGs to the task of genera-

tion. As these researchers note, the properties of TAGs 
for describing the syntactic structuring of a natural lan-
guage mesh quite naturally with the requirements of 
natural-language generation. Nonetheless, generation is 
not, as typically viewed, a problem in natural-language 
syntax. Any system that attempts to use the TAG for-
malism as a substrate upon which to build a generation 
component must devise some mechanism by which a 
TAG can articulate appropriately with semantic infor-
mation. In this paper, we discuss one such mechanism, 
synchronous TAGs, which we have previously proposed 
in the arena of semantic interpretation and automatic 
translation, and examine how it might underly a gener-
ation system of the sort proposed by Joshi and McDon-
ald and Pustejovsky. In particular, synchronous TAGs 
allow for a precise notion of semantic locality corre-
sponding to the syntactic locality of pure TAGs.
# Para 70 1
Scope of the Paper
# Para 71 17
The portion of the full-blown generation problem that 
we address here is what might be referred to as the tac-
tical as opposed to the strategic generation problem. 
That is, we are concerned only with how to compute 
instances of a well-defined relation between strings and 
canonical logical forms1 in the direction from logical 
forms to strings, a problem that is sometimes referred 
to as &quot;reversing&quot; a grammar. This aspect of the gen-
eration problem, which ignores the crucial issues in de-
termining what content to communicate, what predi-
cates to use in the communication, and so forth, can 
be seen as the reverse of the problem of parsing natu-
ral language to derive a semantic representation. The 
citations in the first paragraph can serve to place the 
issue in its historical research context. The other truly 
difficult issues of general natural-language production 
are well beyond the scope of this paper.
# Para 88 2
&apos;This issue of canonicality of logical forms is discussed 
by Shieber (1988).

Semantics in Generation
# Para 92 10
Although Joshi discusses at length the properties of 
TAGs advantageous to the generation task (1987), he 
does not address the issue of characterizing a semantic 
representation off of which generation can proceed. Mc-
Donald and Pustejovsky do mention this issue. Because 
TAGs break up complex syntactic structures into ele-
mentary structures in a particular way, their semantic 
representation follows this structuring by breaking up 
the logical form into corresponding parts. McDonald 
and Pustejovsky consider the sentence
# Para 102 2
(1)How many ships did Reuters report that Iraq had 
said it attacked?
# Para 104 4
Its semantic representation follows the decomposi-
tion of the sentence into its elementary TAG trees— 
corresponding (roughly) to &quot;How many ships ...it at-
tacked&quot;, &quot;did Reuters report that ...&quot; , &quot;Iraq had said
# Para 108 6
&quot; . McDonald and Pustejovsky describe their se-
mantic representation: &quot;The representation we use ... 
amounts to breaking up the logical expression into indi-
vidual units and allowing them to include references to 
each other.&quot; The units for the example at hand would 
be:
# Para 114 1
= A(quantity-of-ships).
# Para 115 1
attack(Iraq, quantity-of-ships)
# Para 116 1
U2 = say(Iraq,U1)
# Para 117 1
U3 = report(Reuters, U2)
# Para 118 3
By composing the units using substitution of equals for 
equals, a more conventional logical form representation 
is revealed:
# Para 121 1
report( Reuters,
# Para 122 1
say(Iraq,
# Para 123 1
)t(quantity-of-ships).
# Para 124 1
attack(Iraq, quantity-of-ships)))
# Para 125 1
Three problems present themselves.
# Para 126 3
First, the particular decomposition of the full seman-
tic form must be explicitly specified as part of the input 
to the generation system.
# Para 129 8
Second, the basic operation that is used (implicitly) 
to compose the individual parts, namely substitution 
does not parallel the primitive operation that TAGs 
make available, namely adjunction. In the particular 
example, this latter problem is revealed in the scope of 
the quantity quantifier being inside the say predicate. 
The more standard representation of scoping would be 
akin to
# Para 137 1
A(quantity-of-ships).
# Para 138 1
(2)	report(Reuters,
# Para 139 1
say(Iraq, attack(Iraq,
# Para 140 1
quantity-of-ships)))
# Para 141 4
but this requires one of the elementary semantic units to 
be &quot;broken up&quot;. Consequently, McDonald and Puste-
jovsky note that they cannot have the logical form (2) 
as the source of the example sentence (1).
# Para 145 14
Third, the grammatical information alone does not 
determine where adjunctions should occur. McDonald 
and Pustejovsky allude to this problem when they note 
that &quot;the [generator] must have some principle by which 
to judge where to start.&quot; In their own example, they 
say that &quot;the two pending units, U2 and U3 are then 
attached to this matrix ... into complement positions,&quot; 
but do not specify how the particular attachment po-
sitions within the elementary trees are chosen (which 
of course has an impact on the semantics). The rela-
tionship between syntax and semantics that they pro-
pose links elementary trees with units of the realization 
specification. Apparently, a more finely structured rep-
resentation is needed.
# Para 159 1
Synchronous TAGs
# Para 160 9
In order to provide an explicit representation for the se-
mantics of strings generated by a TAG, and in so doing 
provide a foundation for the generation efforts of Joshi 
and McDonald and Pusteiovsky, we present an exten-
sion to TAGs, synchronous TAGs, which was originally 
developed just to characterize the declarative relation-
ship between strings and representations of their se-
mantics. The formalism allows us to circumvent some 
of the problems discussed above.
# Para 169 9
The idea underlying synchronous TAGs is simple. 
One can characterize both a natural language and a 
logical form language with TAGs. The relation be-
tween strings in the two languages (sentences and log-
ical forms, respectively) can then be rigorously stated 
by pairing the elementary trees of the two grammars 
and linking the corresponding nodes, forming a new 
grammar whose elements are linked pairs of elementary 
trees.
# Para 178 16
The synchronous TAG formalism addresses all three 
of the problems mentioned above. First, a synchronous 
TAG characterizes a relation between languages. Thus, 
we need not assume that the sentences of the logical 
form language come pre-packaged into their constituent 
units (just as in the case of sentence parsing, where we 
need not assume that sentences come pre-bracketed). 
Second, the operations that are used to build the two 
structures—natural language sentences and semantic 
representations—are stated using the same kinds of 
operations, as they are both characterized by TAGs. 
Third, the linking of individual nodes in the elemen-
tary trees of a synchronous TAG provides just the fine- 
grained relationship between syntax and semantics that 
allows decisions about where to perform semantic op-
erations to be well-defined.

# Para 216 14
A synchronous TAG sufficient for this example in-
cludes the three pairings of trees (labeled a, flu, and (32) 
found in Figure 1. Note that the first components of the 
three pairs constitute a TAG grammar sufficient to gen-
erate the sentence &quot;How many ships did Reuters report 
that Iraq attacked&quot; or &quot;How many ships did Reuters 
report that Iraq said that Iraq attacked&quot;. The second 
components generate strings in a logical form language. 
The syntax of that language includes such phrase types 
as formula (F) or abstracted property (A). The obvious 
linearization of such trees will be assumed, so that the 
logical form in given for the sample sentence is in the 
language. Some of the nodes in the pairs are linked; 
formally, the interpretation of these links is that oper-
# Para 230 10
&apos;The linguistic analysis implicit in the TAG English frag-
ment that we present is not proposed as an appropriate 
one in general. It merely provides sufficient structure to 
make the points vis-i-vis generation. Furthermore, the trees 
that we present here for expository purposes as elementary 
should actually themselves be built from more primitive 
trees. Finally, we gloss over details such as features nec-
essary to control for agreement or verb-form checking, and 
we replace the pronoun with its proper noun antecedent to 
finesse issues in pronominal interpretation. 
# Para 240 4
ations on the tree pairs must occur at both ends of a 
link For simplicity, we have marked only those links 
that will be needed for the derivation of the sample 
sentence.
# Para 244 4
Derivation in the synchronous grammar proceeds by 
choosing a pairing of initial trees from the grammar 
and repeatedly updating it by the following three-step 
process:3
# Para 248 1
1. Choose a link to act upon.
# Para 249 3
2. Choose a pairing such that the two trees can respec-
tively act on (substitute at or adjoin at) the respec-
tive ends of the link chosen in Step 1.
# Para 252 4
3. Remove the chosen link from the trees being updated 
and perform the two operations, one in each of the 
trees. If the trees in the chosen pairing themselves 
have links, these are preserved in the result.
# Para 256 4
For instance, we might start with the initial tree pair 
a from Figure 1. We choose the sole link in a, and 
choose i3u as the tree pair to operate with, as the first 
component of flu can operate (by adjunction) on an S

chosen link The result of performing the adjunctions 
is the pairing given as a + th in Figure 2. The link 
in the A. pair is preserved in the resultant, and can 
serve as the chosen link in the next round of the deriva-
tion. This time, we use f32 to operate at each end of the 
link resulting in the pairing labeled a + + This 
pairing manifests the association between the English 
string &quot;How many ships did Reuters report that Iraq 
said that Iraq attacked&quot; and the logical form represen-
tation in (2).
# Para 301 2
Returning to the three issues cited previously, the 
synchronous TAG presented here:
# Para 303 3
1. Makes the decomposition of the logical forms im-
plicit in the grammar just as the decomposition of 
the natural-language expressions are, by stating the
# Para 306 1
structure of logical forms grammatically.
# Para 307 4
2. Allows the same operations to be used for composing 
both natural-language expressions and semantic rep-
resentations as both are stated with the same gram-
matical tools.
# Para 311 3
3. Makes the fine-grained correspondance between ex-
pressions of natural language and their meanings ex-
plicit by the technique of node linking.
# Para 314 6
The strong notion of semantic locality that synchronous 
TAGs embody makes these results possible. This se-
mantic locality, in turn, is only possible because the ex-
tended domain of locality found in pure TAGs makes it 
possible to localize dependencies that would otherwise 
be spread across several primitive structures.
# Para 320 1

# Para 321 11
Translation with Synchronous TAGs 
Synchronous TAGs as informally described here declar-
atively characterize a relation over strings in two lan-
guages without priority of one of the languages over 
the other. Any method for computing this relation in 
one direction will perforce be applicable to the other 
direction as well. The distinction between parsing and 
generation is a purely informal one depending merely on 
which side of the relation one chooses to compute from; 
both are instances of a process of translating between 
two TAG languages appropriately synchronized.
# Para 332 16
The question of generation with synchronous TAGs 
reverts then to one of whether this relation can be com-
puted in general. There are many issues involved in 
answering this question, most importantly, what the 
underlying TAG formalism (the base formalism) is that 
the two linked TAGs are stated in. The simple exam-
ple above required a particularly simple base formalism, 
namely pure TAGs with adjunction as the only opera-
tion. The experience of grammar writers has demon-
strated that substitution is a necessary operation to 
be added to the formalism, and that a limited form 
of feature structures with equations are helpful as well. 
Work on the use of synchronous TAGs to capture quan-
tifier scoping possibilities makes use of so-called multi- 
component TAGs. Finally, the base TAGs may be lex-
icalized (Schabes et al., 1988) or not.
# Para 348 10
Once the base formalism has been decided upon (we 
currently are using lexicalized multi-component TAGs 
with substitution and adjunction), a simple translation 
strategy from a source string to a target is to parse the 
string using an appropriate TAG parser for the base 
formalism. Each derivation of the source string can 
be mapped according to the synchronizing links in the 
grammar to a target derivation. Such a target deriva-
tion defines a string in the target language which is a 
translate of the source string.
# Para 358 15
In the case of generation, the source string is a se-
mantic representation, the target is a natural-language 
realization. For example, the logical form (2) has a sin-
gle derivation in the pure TAG formed by projecting the 
synchronous TAG onto its semantic component. (We 
might notate the semantic components with a(sem), 
1(sem), and fl2(sem), and analogously for the syntac-
tic components.) That derivation can be recovered by 
&quot;parsing&quot; the logical form with the projected logical 
form grammar, as depicted in Figure 3. The pairings 
whose semantic components were used in this deriva-
tion and the links operated on implicitly define a corre-
sponding derivation on the syntactic side. The yield of 
this derivation is a string whose meaning is represented 
by the logical form that we started with.
# Para 373 5
The target derivation might not, unlike in the exam-
ple above, be in canonical form (as defined by Vijay-
Shanker (1988)), and consequently must be normalized 
to put it into canonical form. Under certain config-
urations of links, the normalization process is nonde-

terministic; thus one source derivation (necessarily in 
canonical form by virtue of properties of the parsing al-
gorithm) may be associated with several canonical tar-
get derivations. In translation from natural language 
to logical forms, the multiple translates typically corre-
spond to scope ambiguities in the source sentence (as 
quantifier scope or scope of negation or adverbs). On 
the other hand, we have not observed the linking config-
urations that give rise to such ambiguities in translating 
in the other direction, that is, in performing generation.
# Para 401 17
In previous work, one of us noted that generation 
according to an augmented context-free grammar can 
be made more efficient by requiring the grammar to 
be semantically monotonic (Shieber, 1988); the derived 
semantics for an expression must include, in an appro-
priate sense, the semantic material of all its sub con-
stituents. It is interesting to note that synchronous 
TAGs are inherently semantically monotonic, and the 
computational advantages that accrue to such gram-
mars apply to synchronous TAG generation as well. 
Furthermore, it is reasonable to require that the se-
mantic component of a synchronous TAG be lexical-
ized (in the sense of Schabes et al. (1988)), allowing for 
more efficient parsing according to the semantic gram-
mar and, consequently, more efficient generation. In 
the case of augmented context-free grammars, the se-
mantic monotonicity requirement precludes &quot;lexicaliza-
# Para 418 1

# Para 419 1

# Para 420 1

# Para 421 12
tion&quot; of the semantics. It is not possible to require 
nontrivial semantics to be associated with each lexi-
cal item. This fact, and the inefficiencies of genera-
tion thatfollow from it, was the initial motivation for 
the move to semantic-head-driven generation (Shieber 
et at, forthcoming). The efficiencies that that algorith-
mgains for augmented-context-free generation inhere in 
the synchronous TAG generation process if the semantic 
gramamr is lexicalized. In summary, just as lexicaliza-
tion of the syntactic grammar aids parsing (Schabes and 
Joshi, 1989), so lexicalization of the semantic grammar 
aids generation.
# Para 433 15
The simple generation algorithm that we have just 
presented seems to require that we completely analyze 
the logical form before generating the target string, as 
the process is a cascade of three subprocesses: parsing 
the logical form to a source derivation, mapping from 
source to target derivation, and computing the target 
derivation yield. As is common in such cases, portions 
of these computations can be interleaved, so that gen-
eration of the target string can proceed incrementally 
while traversing the source logical form. To what ex-
tent this incrementality can be achieved in practice de-
pends on subtleties in the exact formal definition of 
synchronous TAG derivation and properties of particu-
lar grammars; a full explication is beyond the scope of 
this paper.
# Para 448 1
Conclusion
# Para 449 8
The extended domain of locality that tree-adjoining 
grammars enjoy would seem to make them ideal candi-
dates for the task of tactical generation, where seman-
tic locality is of great importance. Synchronous TAGs, 
which extend pure TAGs to allow for mappings between 
languages, provide a formal foundation for this intuition 
by making explicit the semantic locality that generation 
requires.
