Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.999358266666666">
Accessibility of candidate referents is a crucial
factor in successful reference assignment and
this intuition has been adequately
accommodated and developed in centering
theory. By contrast, another equally important
factor involved in reference assignment,
namely, accessibility of contextual
assumptions, seems to have not been
addressed fully as a part of a computational
theory of reference. In the field of pragmatics,
however, the role of context has always been
one of the central issues and the recent
approach to context selection based on the
notion of relevance (Sperber &amp; Wilson
1986/1995) seems to be currently the most
promising. In this paper, I will review and
assess the recent centering approach to the
interpretation of Japanese zero pronouns
(Walker et al. 1994) as a case study, and
suggest that relevance theory can provide one
way of complementing it. In order to
incorporate a needed mechanism of contextual
selection into a model of reference assignment,
model builders must take into account the
hearer&apos;s ability to anticipate certain cognitive
effects that may be achieved by upcoming
utterances. It is my hope that this paper will
lead to a fruitful discussion of finding possible
ways of using Sperber &amp; Wilson&apos;s notion of
relevance in practical applications.

1. Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.979774928571428">
When a system has to assign a referent to a
referring expression, it is almost always the
case that there is more than one candidate
referents and one has to resort to some way of
eliminating the wrong candidates in order to
choose the right one.
There are two main ways of doing this.
First, candidate referents can be ranked on the
basis of accessibility (Erku &amp; Gundel 1987;
Fretheim and Gundel 1996; Gernbacher and
Hargreaves 1988, Grosz et al. 1995; Sidner
1983a, b; Walker et al. 1998). Alternatively,
they can be checked against the accessibility
of contextual assumptions (Fmcher-Kiefer

1995).
In either case, once a candidate is singled
out, the acceptability of the referent needs to
be tested against some pragmatic criteria.
Currently, we seem to have at least three
distinct criteria available:
i. Truth-based criterion — i.e. whether the
overall, interpretation is likely to be
factually plausible (Clark 1977; Clark &amp;
Haviland 1977; Erku &amp; Gundel 1987;
Sanford &amp; Garrod 1981; Sidner 1983a);
Coherence-based criterion — i.e. whether
the overall interpretation is likely to be
coherent (Asher &amp; Lascaries 1993; Grosz
et al. 1995, 1998; Hobbs 1979; Lascarides
&amp; Asher 1993; Sanders et al. 1992; Walker
et al. 1994,1998);
ill. Relevance-based criterion — i.e. whether
the overall interpretation is likely to be
optimally relevant (Matsui 1993, 1995,
1998; Wilson 1992; Wilson &amp; Matsui
1998).

<bodyText confidence="0.946358833333333">
In this paper, I will focus on one version of
coherence-based criterion, namely, centering
theory. One of the goals of centering theory is
to sort out the various mechanisms used to
maintain discourse coherence, and the use of
various referring expressions is regarded as
one such mechanism. Among the various
hypotheses put forward by centering theory,
what concerns us most is the following: that
&apos;each utterance [except the initial utterance] in
•a coherent discourse segment contains a single•
semantic entity the backward-looking center
[or Cb] that provides a link to the previous
utterance, and an ordered set of entities the
forward-looking centers [or Cl] that offer
potential links to the next utterance &apos;(Gordon et
al. 1993:311). There are two rules to provide
constraints on choosing centers, which are
shown in (1):
(1 )Rule 1: If any element of Cf (Un) is
realised by a pronoun in Un+1 then the
Cb (Un+1) must be realised by a
pronoun also.
Rule 2: Sequences of continuation are
preferred over sequences of retaining;
and sequences of retaining are to be
preferred over sequences of shifting.
The first rule states that the most highly
ranked element of the forward-looking center
of a previous utterance is the backward-
looking center of the current utterance, and
must be realised by a pronoun if any element
of the Cf of the previous utterance is realised
by a pronoun in the current utterance. The
following example from Gordon et 4(1993),
shown here in (2), illustrates this rule:
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.679034714285714">
(2)[1]Susan gave Betsy a pet hamster.
Cf=( Susan, Betsy, hamster 1)
[2]She reminded her such hamsters were
quite shy.
Cb=Susan; Cf::(Susan, Betsy, hamsters)
[3]She asked Betsy whether she liked
the gift.
</footnote>
<equation confidence="0.693689">
Cb=Susan; Cf=f Susan, Betsy,
gift=hamster 1)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997522357142857">
[3 1Susan asked her whether she liked
the gift.
Here, the first utterance has no Cb because it is
the initial sentence of a discourse. Its Cf
includes the referents oV &apos;Susan&apos; and &apos;Betsy&apos;
and the semantic interpretation of &apos;a hamster
ranked in that order. The second utterance has
Susan as the Cb and a Cf with Susan. as its
most highly ranked element. The third
utterance preserves the Cb and prominent Cf
from the previous utterance, therefore it
pronominalises the Cb successfully. By
contrast, utterance [31, in which Susan is
realised by a name and Betsy is realised by a
pronoun, leads to stylistic infelicity. According
to Gordon et al., this is due to violation of
Rule 1 mentioned above.
The ranking of forward-looking centers is
generally based on the discourse salience of
each candidate entity. According to Grosz et
al. (1995), although an ultimate criteria for
deciding the ranking has not been worked out
yet, there are evidences to support the idea that
grammatical role such as SUBJECT, OBJECT,
etc., can affect the Cf ranking. Thus, I will
simply assume here the following preference
in ranking forward-looking center shown in
(3), as suggested by Grosz et al. (ibid.):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.483153">
(3)SUBJECr&gt;OBJECT&gt;OTHERS
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997705352941176">
The highest ranked member of the set of
forward-looking centers is called the
&apos;preferred center or &apos;Cp As mentioned
above, Cp is regarded as the most likely
candidate for Cb in the following utterance.
Another important claim made by centering
theory is that discourse segments are more
coherent if they• share the same Cb. On the
basis of this idea, different degrees of
coherence are proposed. For example, Walker
et al. adopt the following 4 types of transition
between discourse segments, each
corresponding to different degree of
coherence, using the notion of Cb and Cp; .
namely, &apos;continue &apos;retain&apos;, &apos;smooth-shift&apos;
and &apos;rough-shift&apos;. These are shown in (4).
When two utterances, say Ui-1 and U share the

same Cb, and the same entity is also the
highest-ranked Cf, i.e. Cp, in Ui-1, the
transition from Ui-1 to Ui is called &apos;continue
When Ui-1 and Ui share the same Cb, but the

same entity is not the highest-ranked Cf in Ui,
the transition is called &apos;retain When Ui-1 and
Ui do not share the same Cb, there are two
possibilities: if Cb in Ui is the same as Cp in
Ui, the transition is &apos;smooth-shift&apos;; if Cb in Ui
is not the same as Cp in Ui, it is &apos;rough-shift
It is claimed that when the hearer has to
choose one from several possible
interpretations, the one based on the most •
coherent transition should be chosen. The 4
transition states are ordered in the following
way according to their preference:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.5308535">
(4)CONTINUE&gt;RETAIN&gt;SMOOTH-
SHIFT&gt;ROUGH-SHIFT
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.849647">
The second of the two rules in (1) is about this
ordered preference of transition states.&apos;
2. Walker et al. (1994) and Japanese zero
pronoun resolution
Walker et al. (1994) propose the following
ranking order of forward-looking centers to
deal with Japanese:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.5854205">
(5)(Grammatical or Zero) TOPIC &gt;
EMPATHY &gt; SUBJECT &gt; OBJECT2 &gt;
</equation>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.870823" genericHeader="method">
OBJECT OTHERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983258770833333">
As you can see, they add two new grammatical
roles, namely, topic and empathy, to the list of
factors affecting pronoun resolution. Since the
notion of topic will become important in the
discussion which follows, I will briefly
describe the Japanese topic marker below. For
empathy-loaded verbs, please refer to Kuno
1987 and ICuno &amp; Kaburald 1977.
In Japanese, both in written and spoken
discourse, NPs which can be recovered from
context are often omitted. The omitted NPs are
often called &apos;zero pronouns It is widely
agreed that missing NPs in Japanese behave
like pronouns in other languages such as
There were only three transition states in the original.
formulation by Grosz et &apos;IL (1983, 1995), namely,
CONTINUE. RETABV and SHIFT The distinction
between SMOOTH-SHIFT and ROUGH-SHIFT war
first proposed in Brennan (1987).
English. Japanese zero pronouns should be
distinguished from missing NPs in &apos;pro-drop&apos;
languages such as Italian, since in &apos;pro-drop&apos;
languages, information to recover missing NPs
is morphologically encoded elsewhere in the
sentence, e.g. in the form of verb inflection,
whereas Japanese lacks such an overt
encoding.
Japanese zero pronouns are used equally
often as inter-sentential discourse anaphors
and intra-sentential anaphors. Here, I will
concentrate on their use as discourse anaphors,
where the role of context and adequate
pragmatic criterion is crucial. For those who
are interested in intra-sentential use of zero
pronouns, please refer to e.g. Hasegawa 1985
and Kameyama 1986.
In Japanese, there are several postpositional
particles. The one we are interested in here is
lwa which is often called a &apos;topic marker&apos;.
As the name suggests, &apos;via&apos; is typically used to
construct a grammatical topic of a sentence,
which is characterised as an entity whose
existence is preSupposed. The function of *a&apos;
might become clearer when it is compared
with another particle &apos;ga which marks a NP
in the subject position, which typically
conveys a new information. Compare (6a) and
(6b):
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.651089">

&apos;John bought flowers.&apos;

TOP flowers ACC bought
&apos;John bought flowers.&apos;
(6a) and (6b) share the same propositional

<bodyText confidence="0.994868">
content. However, only (6a) is acceptable as
an answer to the question such as Who
bought flowers?&apos; while only (6b) is acceptable
as an ansvver to the question such as &apos;What did
John buy? There are various suggestions
about how to characterise functions of the two
particles (see e.g. Shibatani 1990; Tanaka
1991), and although it is an interesting
question on its own, it shouldn &apos;t concern us
here. This is because Walker et al. are only.

which is automatically given the highest
accessibility ranking in their framework.
Walker et al. claim that a topic NP is more
likely to be realised as a zero pronoun in the
subsequent discourse than any other NPs due
to its highest degree of accessibility.
Moreover, in Walker et al.&apos;s framework, topic
NP is given two further advantages: they
suggest (a) that a NP marked by &apos;wa&apos; becomes
the backward-looking center even at the onset
of the discourse; and (b) that once topic NP is
realised as the backward-looking center ,as
long as it continues to be realised as a zero
pronoun in subsequent discourse, it could
continue to be the backward-looking center.
The second advantage given to the topic NP is
called &apos;zero topic assignment&apos;, which is
defined as in (7):
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.928808">
(7)Zero Topic Assignment (ZTA)

<bodyText confidence="0.8253425">
When a zero in Ui+1 represents an entity
that was Cb (Ui), and when no other
CONTINUE transition is available, that
zero may be interpreted as the ZERO
TOPIC of Ui+1
Walker et al. demonstrate that their
framework, including an optional rule of zero
topic assignment, can successfully explain the
preference in the interpretation of the last
sentence in (8):

</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.987504111111111">
According to the questionnaire carried out by
Walker et al., the preferred interpretation of
[4] is that Hanako invited Michiko to lunch.
As you can see, in fact, there are two possible
ways of ranldng forward-looking center in [3],
and two possible ways of deciding both the
backward-looking center and the ranking of
forward-looking center in [4]. In their analysis
of (8), the preference in the interpretation in

• [3] and preference on &apos;continue&apos; transition in

<bodyText confidence="0.981798777777778">
[4].
In summary, Walker et al.&apos;s account of
Japanese zero pronoun is based on two
independent preference mechanisms: the first
one is the forward center ranking, and the
second is the ordered transition states.
However, as Walker et al. themselves point
out, each transition state between discourse
segments is determined by the ordering of
forward looking centers, the predictions of the
theory tend to depend more largely on the
forward center ranking.
3. Problems with Walker et al.
Now I would like to discuss some problems
with Walker et al.&apos;s framework. Needless to
say, it has great advantages, such as relative
ease of computational implementation.
Moreover, I agree that accessibility of
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.996972">
14
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9965861875">
discourse entities plays an important role in
reference assignment, and their forward center
ranking is an adequate enough approximation
of accessibility of discourse entities in
different grammatical categories in Japanese.
However, as I mentioned before, there are
cases whose interpretation process cannot
possibly be explained by the accessibility
factor alone. Accounts of reference assignment
which are largely based on accessibility of
discourse entities tend to exhibit their
weaknesses when they face cases which
require some pragmatic inferences, and
Walker et al. is not an exception here. I will
illustrate two problems they need to solve
below.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.448631">
3.1. Multiple topics
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.899084743589744">
One of the most obvious shortcomings of
Walker et al. &apos;s approach is that it cannot
handle situations where there is more than one
topic in a sentence. In their framework, in
order to identify zero pronouns, the backward-
looking center has to be identified first. The
backward-looking center, in turn, is
determined by the way forward-looking
centers are ranked. Therefore, the most
powerful mechanism in their framework is the
forward-looking center ranking shown in (5)
above. However, notice that it is only useful if
there is no more than one entity in each
category in a sentence.
Let us concentrate on the category of topic
here. In Walker et al. &apos;s framework, the topic
matter `wa &apos; is given a special status: the topic
marker `wa &apos; is so powerful that the topic NP
becomes the most highly ranked forward-
looking center even at the onset of a discourse;
in addition, once a topic NP is realised as the
backward-looking center, as long as it
continues to be realised as zero pronoun in
subsequent discourse, it could continue to be
the backward-looking center. This status of the
topic NP rightly allows the possibility of
multiple topics as in (9), which is very often
seen in Japanese discourse:
(9)(l] Mary to Jane wa shinyuu da.

&apos;Mary and Jane are each other&apos;s best
friend.&apos;

[4]0 0 eiga ni sasou tsumori datta.
film to invite planning to was
`(She) was planning to invite (her) to a
film.&apos;
However, cases of multiple topics cause a
serious problem to Walker et al. Here, the
preferred interpretation of [4] is that Jane was
planning to invite Mary to a film. Walker et al.
might explain this preference by saying that
this is because &apos;Jane&apos; is the backward-looking
center in [4]. According to their framework,
however, the alternative interpretation,
namely, that Mary was planning to invite Jane
to a film, is equally accessible, since Mary&apos;
could continue to be the backward-looking
center in [4]. The problem is that in their
current framework, Walker et al. do not
provide any mechanism to choose one
interpretation and discard the other.
There is another problem concerning
multiplicity of entities with equal degree of
accessibility. In Japanese, post-positional
particles such as &apos;wa &apos; and &apos;ga &apos; shouldn &apos;t be
used more than once in a sentence. Thus, you
wouldn&apos;t come across sentences with two
overtly marked topics or subjects. However, it
is possible to have more than one NP with
more or less equal salience in one sentence, for
example, when two nouns, the first being a
modifier and the second being the head noun,
form a NP. A noun modifier is followed by a
particle &apos;no 1, the Genitive Case particle. Some
examples of NPs which contain noun
modifiers are shown in (10):
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.783437">

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.839121566666667">
&apos;A reply to the letter&apos;
Here, the first noun in each NP is the modifier.
The most typical relation exhibited between
two nouns combined by the particle &apos;no&apos; is the
&apos;possessive&apos; relation, as in (10a): However, the
use of &apos;no&apos; is by no means restricted to that
relation, as illustrated in (10b) and (10c). Now
consider (11), which include a NP with this
structure:
(11)(A memo written by a man, and

In (11), &apos;one of the buttons of my coat&apos; is
introduced in [1] as the subject of the sentence.
What is important here is thatthe NP
introduces two conceptual entities, namely, a
&apos;coat&apos; and a button which are equally
accessible. The question is whether Walker et
al. &apos;s framework can handle cases like (11). For
[2], the preferred interpretation is that the
speaker wants his wife to find and fix the
button today. Walker et al. &apos;s system would
successfully predict that the button is the
backward-center. for [2] and [3]. However, for
[4], the preferred interpretation is that the
speaker will need his coat tomorrow, rather
than the button. I do not see how Walker et al.
can explain this. Example (12) causes exactly
the same problem for them. Walker et al.
would predict that the preferred interpretation
should be that the key has gone. This
obviously is the wrong prediction. The point .I
would like to make here is that there are many
cases in Japanese discourse where there is
more than one roughly equally salient
discourse entity in a sentence which
subsequently become equally strong candidate
referents for zero pronouns, and some
mechanism of choosing the right one is
needed.

difficult to think of examples which go against

Let us look at (13) rust. What interests me
here is the interpretation of the zero pronoun

equally acceptable in terms of factual
plausibility. In such case, Walker et al. would
predict that Pa], which exhibits a &apos;continue&apos;
transition should be preferred. However, for
some reason, the preferred interpretation for
[3] is not [3a], but [3b]. Similarly, in (14), the
preferred interpretation for [2] is definitely
[2b]. However, Walker et al. predict that [2a]
should be preferred. Obviously, their
mechanism based on the accessibility of
transition states makes wrong predictions. In
the next section, I will consider why this is the
case.

intended by the speaker. However, it differs
from Gricean approach in two crucial points: it
does not take the view that we have to follow
maxims, nor the view that we have to -be co-
operative, to achieve successful
communication. Sperber &amp; Wilson claim that
what makes communication achievable at all
is a fundamental mechanism built in our
cognitive system, namely, the pursuit of
relevance. This is expressed as the First, or
Cognitive, Principle of Relevance:
(15)Cognitive Principle of Relevance
Human Cognition tends to be geared to the
maximisation of relevance.
The notion of relevance is defined in terms
cognitive effects, i.e. some changes in the
belief system, and processing effort to obtain
such effects:
(16)Relevance
a. The greater the cognitive effects, the greater
the relevance;
b. The smaller the effort needed to achieve
those effects, the greater the relevance.
Cognitive effects result from the interaction of
new and old (or contextual) information in one
of the following three ways: (a) combining
wit]) -an existing assumption to yield
contextual implications; (b) strengthening an
existing assumption; (c) contradicting and
eliminating an existing assumption; Processing
effort is the mental effort needed to parse the
utterance, decide what proposition and
propositional attitude it was intended to
express, access an appropriate context, and
work out the contextual effects of the utterance
in the context. When an utterance has more
than one possible interpretation, the hearer
should look for the one which satisfies the
following conditions of optimal relevance:
(17)Optimal relevance
An utterance is optimally relevant to the hearer
iff:
a. it is relevant enough to be worth the hearer&apos;s

<bodyText confidence="0.993917322580646">
processing effort;
b. it is the most relevant one compatible with
the speaker&apos;s abilities and preferences.
The Second, or Communicative Principle of
Relevance, governs this search process:
(18)Communicative Principle of Relevance
Every utterance communicates a presumption
of its own optimal relevance.
The pursuit of optimally relevant interpretation
suggests a pattern of comprehension procedure
the hearer should follow, which can be spelled
out as (19):
(19)Relevance-theoretic comprehension
procedure
a. consider cognitive effects in their order
of accessibility (i.e. follow a path of least
effort);
b. stop when the expected level of relevance is
achieved.
Now let me illustrate how this
comprehension procedure should work for
Japanese zero pronoun resolution illustrated in
(11), (12), (13) and (14). In Matsui (1995,
1998, also Wilson and Matsui 1998), I have
developed the idea proposed by Wilson (1992)
that in addition to the factor of accessibility of
candidate referents, there is another important
factor which affects the hearer&apos;s choice of
referent, namely, accessibility of contextual
assumptions. Accessibility of contextual
assumptions becomes particularly crucial
when there is more than one roughly equally
accessible candidate referent, and it is the
factor which is vital to solve problems with
Walker et al.. In fact, the importance of
contextual assumptions in reference resolution
had been recognised before and various
proposals were made as to how to retrieve the
right context: some appeal to situationally
partitioned knowledge (e.g. Sanford &amp; Garrod
1981) and others are motivated by textual
coherence (e.g. Hobbs 1979; Asher &amp;
Lascarides 1993). The account pursued here is
different from any existing accounts in that it
claims that the selection of contextual
assumptions is ordered in terms of both their
accessibility and likeliness to contribute
towards cognitive effects of the utterance. In
other words, in relevance theory, it is assumed
that these candidate referents are tested in
parallel, with the one which gives quickest
access to a context in which the utterance as a
whole yields an acceptable overall
interpretation being selected.
As a working hypothesis, let us assume that
certain contextual assumptions are accessed by
the hearer after the immediately preceding
utterance is processed, during and after the
current utterance is being processed. I have no
specific claim here concerning what triggers
the retrieval or the construction of certain
contextual assumptions, and can go along with
existing suggestions (e.g. it can be triggered by
lexical information, or/and by situational
knowledge). As the second working
hypothesis, I would like to suggest that after
having understood an utterance, the hearer
tends to have, if not always, fairly accurate
expectation as to what kind of cognitive
effects he would like to obtain from the next
utterance. Relevance theory predicts that when
an utterance creates in the hearer an
expectation for a specific cognitive effect to be
achieved by the next utterance, other things
being equal, the hearer is more likely to spend
his processing effort to find an interpretation
which can achieve such cognitive effect when
interpreting the utterance. As a consequence,
the candidate referent which is not the highest
in the general accessibility ranking can
become the most accessible to the hearer if the
referent is expected to contribute to the
interpretation he is looking for. In other words,
relevance theory predicts the alteration of
accessibility ranking of the candidate referents
as a result of the pursuit of certain cognitive
effects.
Consider examples (11) and (12) in the
context discussed above. In (11), the utterance
in [31 is a request to the wife to find and fix
the missing button of the speaker&apos;s coat before
tomorrow. Generally, if someone asks you to
do something by certain time, there should be
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.989718">
18
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999537959183674">
a good reason for such a time limit, since the
time limit in turn may create certain priority.
Thus, it should be reasonable to assume that
after hearing the utterance in [3], the question
such as &apos;why do I have to do it today?&apos; or
&apos;can &apos;t it wait a little while?&apos; occurred in the
hearer &apos;s mind. If so, the utterance in [4] can
readily be interpreted as the reason why he
made such a request he wants to wear the coat
on the following day. The referent is assigned
automatically during the process of finding
expected the cognitive effects. Of course, what
he needs is the coat with the button fixed, and
this interpretation is only possible with the
overall interpretation in which the &apos;coat&apos;,
rather than the &apos;button , is the referent of the
zero pronoun. The first utterance in (12), on
the other hand, seems to create different kind
of expectation in the hearer. After hearing that
the bicycle was left unlocked, the most likely
question occurs to everyone&apos;s mind is &apos;what
happened to the bicycle?&apos; We all know the
likely consequence of the unlocked bicycle,
and the hearer of (12) gets the expected
contextual effects by interpreting the zero
pronoun as the &apos;bicycle&apos;, rather than the &apos;key
In both (13) and (14), it is reasonably
assumed that the hearer will have a why-
question in his mind before hearing the final
utterance. In the case of (13), the only possible
reason why John could not confirm the time
with Peter by phone was because Peter was
not at home when John phoned, and the zero
pronoun is resolved automatically in the
process of obtaining this interpretation. I will
look at (14) in more detail. The interpretation
of (14) might be explained like this. After
processing the first utterance, certain
assumptions might become moderately
accessible (but not necessarily at the conscious
level) to the hearer: e.g. various assumptions
about John and his boss, and more general
assumptions about being ashamed of&apos;, e.g.
that one must feel unhappy about such
situation, or that one must have specific
reasons for such feeling, etc. In this way,
contextual assumptions might contribute to
form the hearer&apos;s anticipation about the way
subsequent utterances achieve relevance.
When the hearer interprets the second
utterance in (14), further&amp;quot; -assumptions related
to the event described, such as that &apos;workers
are encouraged to come to work early &apos;, or
&apos;bosses like their workers to arrive before
them&amp;quot; etc., might become highly accessible.
Such assumptions contribute to the hearer&apos;s
search for the way the utterance could achieve
cognitive effects. At the final stage of the
interpretation process, the hearer finds the only
way in which the second utterance in (14)
might be intended to achieve relevance in a
context created by the first namely, as an
explanation for why John cannot help feeling
ashamed of himself in front of his boss and
the zero-pronouns are resolved automatically
in the process.
Furthermore, notice that as a consequence
of using the notion of accessibility of
contextual assumptions, an ad hoc system such
as the ordered preference in transition states in
Walker et aL &apos;s account becomes automatically
unnecessary. For example, our framework
could easily accommodate cases such as (13)
and (14), where the referent of a zero pronoun
in the current discourse is not the same as that
of a zero pronoun in the preceding discourse,
as well as cases where the most accessible
candidate referent indeed coincides with the
referent chosen on the basis of the preferred
overall interpretation. Recall that the ordered
transition states is created on the basis of the
assumption that the hearer prefers an
interpretation which exhibits &apos;continue&apos;
relation, because such an interpretation
requires less processing effort. I suggest that
this assumption is ultimately wrong for the
following reason: the preferred interpretation
by the hearer is the one which provides
enough cognitive effects worth his processing
effort, rather than the one which merely
requires less processing effort. Walker et al.
would predict that the preferred interpretation
for the second sentence in (14) is that &apos;John
always comes to his office earlier than his
boss.&apos; The question we have to ask here is:
how could this interpretation possibly achieve
relevance? I cannot easily see how. Relevance
theory predicts that such interpretation will
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.994618944444445">
never be considered when there is an
alternative interpretation accessible which
achieves relevance, even if the latter might
require more processing effort. Notice here
that the relevance theory shares the view that
the intended interpretation should be the most
accessible one for the hearer. However, in the
framework of relevance theory, it is
accessibility of contextual assumptions,
together with the accessibility of contextual
referents, that determines the overall
accessibility of an interpretation. In this way,
the fact that the preferred interpretation of the
second sentence in (14) is more accessible
overall for most of us, than the alternative
interpretation, is adequately explained in this
framework.
S. Summary
In this paper, I have proposed a way of
complementing centering theory from a
relevance-theoretic perspective. I have
suggested that a model of reference
assignment which appeals to the expectation
based on the accessibility of candidate
referents such as centering theory should
ultimately accommodate some mechanism of
contextual selection and pointed out that the
hearer&apos;s expectation of specific contextual
effects (a type of forward inferences) should
be taken advantage of in creating such a
mechanism. Recently, Oberlander (1998) says
that &apos;the key lesson from the work on pronoun
generation and interpretation is that we must
develop a more sophisticated view of
&apos;expectation.&amp;quot; I hope this paper makes some
contribution towards that goal.
