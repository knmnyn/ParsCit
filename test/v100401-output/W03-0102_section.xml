Abstract

<bodyText confidence="0.9970235">
Issues in the description of places are discussed
in the context of a logical geospatial theory.
This theory lies at the core of the system Ge-
oLogica, which deduces answers to geographi-
cal questions based on knowledge provided by
multiple agents.

1 Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999400076923077">
Many questions cannot be answered from information in
a single geographical source; often the answer must be
deduced from information provided by several sources.
It may not be obvious which sources to consult. Because
multiple sources seldom agree on conventions of nomen-
clature or notation, it becomes a problem to determine
what place corresponds to a particular description. The
same name may apply to many places, and the same place
may have many names.
In the system GeoLogica, the coordination between
multiple information sources is carried out by an auto-
mated deduction system, or theorem prover, that operates
in a formal geospatial theory. GeoLogica differs from a
search engine in that, instead of merely finding a list of
documents with vocabulary that matches the question, it
attempts to understand the question and provide an an-
swer.
In developing this system, we have been forced to de-
velop systematic ways for naming places, and for identi-
fying places corresponding to given descriptions.
In this paper, we shall first describe the GeoLogica sys-
tem. We’ll present the representation of place names and
discuss mechanisms for finding places corresponding to a
given description. We’ll discuss the solution of a sample
problem, mention some related work, and describe pro-
posed extensions.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998427282608696">
Questions are posed to GeoLogica in a subset of English
and translated into logic by a natural language parser,
the system Gemini (Dowding et al., 1993). The logi-
cal form of the question is rephrased as a theorem and
presented to the theorem prover SNARK (Stickel et al.,
2000). (A knowledgeable user of GeoLogica may pre-
fer to bypass the parser and phrase the query directly in
logical form.) The geospatial theory that SNARK uses
for this application consists of a set of axioms, logical
sentences that provide definitions and describe properties
of important spatial constants, functions, and relations,
including those in the logical form of the query. When
SNARK proves a theorem, it shows that the theorem fol-
lows logically from the axioms in the theory. SNARK
also has an answer-extraction mechanism; in addition to
proving the validity of the theorem, it can extract from the
proof an answer to the query encoded in the theorem, us-
ing mechanisms originally developed for automated pro-
gram synthesis as well as question answering.(Manna and
Waldinger, 1980)
Using the appropriate axioms, SNARK transforms and
decomposes the query to simpler and simpler subqueries.
If the right subqueries of the query are answered, SNARK
can extract the answer to the main query from the proof.
Answers may be logical terms or, when demanded, visu-
alizations, such as maps or satellite images. There may
be many proofs of a theorem, and each proof may yield a
different answer; it is possible to induce SNARK to find
more and more proofs of the same theorem, and hence
more and more answers to the query.
SNARK has some geospatial knowledge that is built
into its axioms, but it has access to a far larger body
of knowledge through its procedural attachment mech-
anism. Procedural attachment allows subqueries to be
answered by external knowledge sources, which may be
programs or data bases and may reside on any machine
accessible through the Web. We shall use the generic term
”agent” for an external program invoked by the procedu-
ral attachment mechanism.
The capabilities of agents are advertised by axioms in
the theory, and the agents themselves are linked to sym-
bols of the theory, so they may be invoked when they are
appropriate. The procedural-attachment mechanism al-
lows SNARK to behave as if the information possessed
by the external agents were represented as axioms in the
geospatial theory.

4 Answer extraction from proofs
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995772">
A query to GeoLogica is translated by Gemini into a log-
ical expression Q[?x], which contains a variable ?x. (Our
convention is to prefix variables with question marks.)
This is taken as a theorem to be proved. In this con-
text, the variable in the theorem stands for an object to
be found. The query asks us to find a value for ?x such
that Q[?x] must be true. We may write the logical form
of the query as
find ?x such that Q[ ? x] .
During the proof, the variable ?x will be instantiated, that
is, replaced by other terms, which may in turn contain
other variables to be instantiated.
Let us give a simple example. Suppose our query is
find ?x such that mother (john, ? x) .
In other words, our task is to find an entity ?x that is the
mother of John. Assume that our theory contains the ax-
iom
mother(john, sue),
i.e., the mother of John is Sue. Then the proof is immedi-
ately complete, and the variable ?x is instantiated to sue.
That is, Sue is the answer to our query.
Of course, in general, the answer will not be provided
by a single axiom; a sequence of inferences will be nec-
essary, and components of the answer will only be dis-
covered gradually.

5 The geospatial theory
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9978039375">
The geospatial theory provides the meanings for the sym-
bols in the query, describes the relationships between var-
ious geospatial concepts, advertises the capabilities of our
agents, and serves as a repository of knowledge in its
own right. One of the first problems we had to face in
developing this theory was to provide a way of repre-
senting named geographical features. It is desirable for
such a place to have a name that allows us to identify it
uniquely. For instance, while Springfield, United States
does not uniquely specify a town, Springfield, Illinois,
United States does.
We have developed a hierarchical naming scheme that
allows us to mimic the mechanism used in addressing
mail to provide a logical term that designates a named
place.
We distinguish between
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.992641555555556">
• regions, which stand for areas on Earth, not neces-
sarily contiguous.
• geographical feature types, such as countries, cities,
lakes, or schools.
• subregion indicators, such as Illinois or Springfield,
which name subregions of a given region.
Then our named regions are built up as follows:
• Earth is the entire Earth.
• feature(
</listItem>
<equation confidence="0.502381666666667">
?geographical-feature-type,
?subregion-indicator,
?region)’
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.93345682">
is the subregion of ?region whose name
is ?subregion-indicator and whose type is
?geographical-feature-type.
Our convention is that ?region is a variable that stands for
a region, and so forth.
For instance,
feature(country, Canada, Earth)
stands for the country Canada, and
feature(
city,
Paris,
feature(country, France, Earth))
stands for the city Paris, France. GeoLogica abbreviates
countries by their names; thus Canada is simply canada.
It is not intended that notations of the above form are
to be used by people; the average user of GeoLogica will
never see them. They are used for the internal represen-
tation of places as terms in a logical theory.
Nothing guarantees that terms of the above form stand
for places that exist or are unique:
feature(
city,
springfield,
united states)
is not unique, and
feature(city, new-york, japan)
does not exist.
Properties of these terms are specified by axioms in the
geospatial theory.
It should be understood that a function symbol such
as feature does not stand for a program that can be com-
puted; it is a notation for speaking about a place.
Strings, Names, and Places
In formulating the geospatial theory we have found it
necessary to distinguish between strings, names, and the
entities they stand for. For instance, canada is a sym-
bol that denotes the actual country Canada, a region on
Earth. The string ”Canada”, on the other hand, is merely
a string, that could be the name of a person rather than a
country. Between them we have the name
regionq(&amp;quot;Canada&amp;quot;)
which denotes the name of the country Canada, not the
country itself. Here regionq maps a string into the cor-
responding name, although a corresponding region may
not exist. We do not assume that a country has a unique
name, nor is it impossible for the same name to stand for
two countries, although this is more common for cities
than for countries. The relation between the name for a
region and the region itself is called region-val. In other
words,
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.679966333333333">
region-val(
regionq(?region-string),
?country)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.933146523809524">
is true if ?region-string is a name for ?country. Thus, for
example,
region-val(
regionq(&amp;quot;Canada&amp;quot;), canada)
is true because ”Canada” is a name for the country
Canada.
Geographical Feature Types
It is necessary to deal explicitly with geographical fea-
ture types within a geospatial theory. We may be asked
to find a feature of a certain type. The Alexandria Digi-
tal Library Gazetteer requires us to specify the type of a
region before it will attempt to find it. We have incorpo-
rated the ADL’s feature type classification scheme, which
is hierarchical. For example, capital is a subtype of city,
which is a subtype of populated place.
We also distinguish between types and their name
strings, because different agents may have different con-
ventions for specifying types. The ADL, for instance,
uses plural strings to stand for types. Thus the string
”countries” corresponds to the geographical feature type
country.

boxes
Another way of describing places on Earth is by coor-
dinate systems, such as latitude and longitude. There
are many representations for latitudes and longitudes, in
terms of numbers or strings. For example, the 37th North
latitude can be represented by the signed string ”37” or
the compass string ”37N”. We can also use decimal nota-
tion, or the notation based on degrees, minutes, and sec-
onds. Different knowledge agents will produce different
representation of latitude and longitude as outputs, and
expect different representations as inputs. For instance,
the Alexandria Digital Library Gazetteer agent accepts
and produces latitudes and longitudes in signed string no-
tation. The agent that computes the distance between lat-
itude/longitude pairs requires latitudes and longitudes in
compass notation. The axiom that advertises an agent
must specify the notations expected and produced. The
geospatial theory, therefore, must discriminate between
these notations. Also, some agents will be able to convert
from one representation to another.
For latitudes and longitudes represented in compass
notation, there is a function symbol
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.675302333333333">
lat-long-compass(
?lat-compass,
?long-compass)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.737500454545455">
that yields the corresponding latitude/longitude pair.
Similarly, for the signed notation, there is the function
symbol
lat-long-sign-string(
?lat-sign-string,
?long-sign-string).
The bounding box of a region is the smallest rectangle
that encloses the region, where the sides of the bound-
ing box are made of latitude and longitude lines. Our
notations for bounding boxes resembles those for lati-
tude/longitude pairs. Thus
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.69889">
bounding-box-sign-string(
?lat-sign-string1,
?lat-sign-string2,
?long-sign-string1,
?long-sign-string2)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.98964425">
is the bounding box determined by the four numbers
given in signed string notation. The numbers correspond
to the north, south, east, and west extremes, respectively,
of the region in question. Note that the bounding box of
a region may contain a lot of terrain outside the region in
question. The bounding box of the United States includes
much of Canada and Mexico.
In the language of the geospatial theory, region-to-lat-
long(?region) is the function that maps a region into its
bounding box.
The geospatial theory can be extended to deal with rep-
resentations of the boundaries of regions, such as vectors
of latitude/longitude pairs.
The Procedural Attachment Mechanism
The procedural attachment mechanism allows an agent
that is attached to a symbol in the theory to be executed
while the proof is in progress. Let us consider a sim-
ple example. Suppose that our proof-in-progress contains
somewhere the term
plus (? real, 2) ,
where ?real stands for a real number. Assume that the
symbol plus is attached to an agent, an ordinary pro-
gram, that performs numerical addition. Because ?real is
a variable that has not yet been instantiated, or assigned
a value, the agent cannot operate. But now assume that,
at some step in the proof, the variable ?real is instantiated
by constant 3. Then the resulting term
plus (3, 2)
is sent to the external addition program, which returns the
constant 5.
The Alexandria Digital Library gazetteer is used for
several purposes, and the gazetteer is procedurally at-
tached to more than one symbol in the theory. For in-
stance, the symbol place-to-lat-long invokes the gazetteer
simply to find the bounding box corresponding to some
place whose name is ?region-string and whose type is
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.595804125">
named ?geo-feature-type-string.
place-to-lat-long(
?region-string,
?geo-feature-type-string,
?lat-sign-string1,
?lat-sign-string2,
?long-sign-string1,
?long-sign-string2).
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.98701525">
The above place-to-lat-long is used mainly to find
countries, which are usually uniquely specified by their
names.
For example, suppose our proof-in-progress contains
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.962235428571429">
the formula
place-to-lat-long(
&amp;quot;Zimbabwe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;countries&amp;quot;,
?lat-sign-string1,
?lat-sign-string2,
?long-sign-string1,
?long-sign-string2).
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.976319785714286">
Then the ADL Gazetteer will be invoked to find the
bounding box for Zimbabwe. The variables in the above
formula will be instantiated appropriately. SNARK will
behave exactly as if the axiom
place-to-lat-long(
&amp;quot;Zimbabwe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;countries&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;-15.22&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;-22.93&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;33.65&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;25.11&amp;quot;).
were included in the geospatial theory. For this reason,
we call the above sentence a ”virtual axiom.”
Other symbols are procedurally attached to more com-
plex invocations of the ADL, which find a region that
is a subregion of a given named region, bounding box,
or both. These invocations are necessary when there are
many places with the same name, and we need to tell the
Gazetteer which one we mean.
Axioms that Advertise the Capabilities of an Agent
By advertising an agent with one or more axioms, we
allow it to be invoked when it is appropriate. This makes
it easy to add new agents without reprogramming the sys-
tem. When a new query is presented, the agents that are
appropriate for its subqueries stand forward, invoked not
by name but as a by-product of the theorem-proving pro-
cess.
Some of the simplest of these axioms are those that ad-
vertise agents that translate from one notation to another.
For example, the agent that translates from the signed
string notation to the compass notation for latitude and
longitude is advertised by the axiom
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.820291833333333">
lat-long-compass(
?lat-compass, ?long-compass) =
lat-long-sign-string(
lat-compass-to-sign-string(
?lat-compass),
long-compass-to-sign-string(
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.937702875">
?long-compass)).
Here lat-compass-to-sign-string and long-compass-to-
sign-string are function symbols with procedural attach-
ments to programs that perform the conversion from com-
pass notation to signed string notation, for latitudes and
longitudes, respectively.
Applying this axiom to a lat-long pair in compass no-
tation, such as
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.873621666666667">
lat-long-compass(&amp;quot;37N&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;122E&amp;quot;)
will yield the term
lat-long-sign-string(
lat-compass-to-sign-string(&amp;quot;37N&amp;quot;),
long-compass-to-
sign-string(&amp;quot;122E&amp;quot;)).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.962283625">
Because of the procedural attachments to the function
symbols, the compass notation will be converted to
signed string notation, yielding the term lat-long-sign-
string(”37”, ”-122”).
Now let us look at one of the axioms that advertises
the Alexandria Digital Library Gazetteer. The following
axiom will invoke the gazetteer to find the bounding box
for a country:
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.788453294117647">
(region-to-lat-long(?country) =
bounding-box-sign-string(
?lat-sign-string1,
?lat-sign-string2,
?long-sign-string1,
?long-sign-string2))
&lt;=
(region-val (
regionq(
?region-string),
?country) &amp;
place-to-lat-long(
?region-string, &amp;quot;countries&amp;quot;,
?lat-sign-string1,
?lat-sign-string2,
?long-sign-string1,
?long-sign-string2)).
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.997981">
In other words, to find the bounding box (in signed string
notation) for a country, find a string that can serve as a
name for the country and submit that string, with geo-
graphical feature type string ”countries”, to the gazetteer.
The resulting four number strings will correspond to the
desired bounding box.

7 A Sample Problem.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991003">
Let us consider a problem solved by GeoLogica to illus-
trate the discovery of a place characterized by a logical
combination of properties. The query is
Show a petrified forest in Zimbabwe within 750
miles of the capital of South Africa.
Here, our convention is that ”show” means to display a
satellite image, using the TerraVision three-dimensional
terrain viewer.
The logical form of the query is

<equation confidence="0.8912413">
find ?x such that
show (? x) &amp;
patient (? x, ? y) &amp;
petrified-forest (? y) &amp;

count (? z, 750) &amp;
capital (?u) &amp;
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.988829954545455">
capital-of(?u, south-africa).
In other words, we want to find ?x which is a showing of
?y, where ?y is a petrified forest that is in Zimbabwe and
within a distance ?z of ?u, where ?z is in units of miles
and has a magnitude of 750, and ?u is the capital of South
Africa.
We will not follow the proof in detail; it will be de-
scribed informally, with indication of where the principal
agents were invoked, and what virtual axioms were intro-
duced.
To show a region in TerraVision, it is necessary to find
the center of its bounding box, because that is the point
we have TerraVision focus on. To find a petrified forest in
Zimbabwe, we first find the bounding box of Zimbabwe;
this is given by the virtual axiom
place-to-lat-long(
&amp;quot;Zimbabwe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;countries&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;-15.22&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;-22.93&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;33.65&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;25.11&amp;quot;),
as we have seen.
Then we search for petrified forests within that bound-
ing box, checking to see that they are indeed in Zim-
babwe. The subquery is
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.8017195">
place-to-lat-long-part-of-type-bounds(
?region-string, &amp;quot;petrified forests&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;Zimbabwe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;countries&amp;quot;,

?lat-sign-string2,
?long-sign-string1,
?long-sign-string2).
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.84418158974359">
This causes an invocation of the Alexandria Digital Li-
brary Gazetteer in a more complicated way than before.
We only specify the type, petrified forest, of the region
we are looking for, not its name; we search only within
the bounding box of Zimbabwe; and we insist that the
found region be a subregion of the country Zimbabwe.
The location of the single petrified forest in Zimbabwe
is given by the virtual axiom
place-to-lat-long-part-of-type-bounds(
&amp;quot;Makuku Fossil Forest&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;petrified forests&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;Zimbabwe&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;countries&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;- 15.22&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;- 22.93&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;33.65&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;25.11&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;- 15.65&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;- 15.65&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;29.95&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;29.95&amp;quot;).
Note that, though we have requested a bounding box,
the ADL has actually given us a latitude/longitude pair
-15.65, 29.95; the north and south latitudes, and the east
and west longitudes, are respectively the same.
It is still necessary to ensure that the petrified forest
we have found satisfies the additional constraint, that it
be within 750 miles of the capital of South Africa. The
name of the capital of South Africa, Pretoria, is discov-
ered by invoking the ASCS search engine, which contains
the DAML encoding of the CIA World Factbook, includ-
ing the capitals of countries.
To ensure that the forest is within 750 miles of Pre-
toria, we first find the latitude and longitude of Pretoria,
using the ADL again. We then use a geographical com-
putational agent to ensure that the distance between the
latitude/longitudes for the forest and for Pretoria is suf-
ficiently small. The virtual axiom provided by the agent
is
lat-long-dist(&amp;quot;25.75S&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;28.16667E&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;15.65S&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;29.95E&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;708.0386&amp;quot;).
Note that this agent requires compass notation—it will
not accept signed strings. The agent determines that the
distance between Pretoria and the forest is 708 miles,
within the 750-mile limit that was specified in the query.

Here are some other forms of queries that can be an-
swered using the current implementation of GeoLogica:

What is the capital of Zimbabwe.
What is the distance from Arcturus, Zimbabwe
to the capital of Cuba?
Display the Generic Mapping Tools map for a
beach in Thailand.
Show a cave in Afghanistan within 100 miles
of Kandahar, Afghanistan.
Show another.
Show a place in which Mohammed Atta met
with an Iraq official.
A question such as “Show another” is treated by allow-
ing SNARK to continue where it left off, finding another
proof to the previous theorem, and hence another answer
to the previous question. This can be done repeatedly un-
til the set of answers found is depleted.
The last question uses TextPro to establish that Mo-
hammed Atta visited the airport at Ruzyne, Czech Re-
public, on June 2, 2000. At the same time, the alleged
Iraq secret service al Ani was with the Iraq embassy to
the Czech republic. Embassies are in capital cities, and
the ADL Gazetteer tells us that Ruzyne is less that 7 miles
from Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. TerraV-
ision then displays a satellite image of Ruzyne. It might
be mentioned that it is unclear whether such a meeting
ever did take place.
10 Use of the gazetteer
The ADL Gazetteer is the agent we rely on most. We
have found that we needed to exhibit care in two areas,
the treatment of variant or alternative names and the treat-
ment of parts or subregions.
Let us illustrate the alternative names problem. For
each place name, the gazetteer maintains a set of alterna-
tive names. It generally prefers the local name for a place
to the English name. Thus, ask for Prague, Czechoslo-
vakia and it will give you Praha. Ask for Bangkok, Thai-
land, and it will give you Krung Thep.
On the other hand, the gazetteer also returns the names
of places with names that contain the name we want.
Search for Chicago, Illinois, and we will find Chicago
Ridge, Chicago Heights, and East Chicago, as well as
”Chicago (country seat)”, which is the place we want.
Thus we must be careful to accept true alternative names,
such as Chicago (county seat) and Praha, while discard-
ing false alternative names such as East Chicago.
We have also gone through some trouble to ensure that,
in searching for a place name within a region, we do
not capture places that are within the bounding box of
the region but outside the region itself. For instance, in
earlier implementations, when searching for Kansas City,
Kansas, we would also find Kansas City, Missouri. The
bounding box of Kansas contains both cities. Neither city
is listed directly as apart of a state. Both cities were listed
as parts of places that contained the string ”Kansas” in
their names. Kansas City, Missouri, is part of the Kansas
City MO topographic map, for instance. So we would
find both cities.
This problem has been solved by adopting a more pre-
cise test of subregion membership; we follow a chain of
regions that contain Kansas City, until we get the actual
state of Kansas. Thus, Kansas City, Kansas, is listed
as a part of Wyandotte County, which in turn is part of
Kansas.
11 Relation to other work
There is a large body of work, not surveyed here, in us-
ing theorem proving to answer questions or to synthesize
programs from specifications. The approach of using pro-
cedural attachment to a logical theory to coordinate mul-
tiple agents is relatively new, but see Infomaster (Gene-
sereth et al., 1993) and Ariadne (Knoblock and Minton,
1998). The system CYC (Lenat and Guha, 1998) in-
cludes a large theory of spatial reasoning and now also
incorporates procedural attachment.
Fonseca et al. (Fonseca et al., 2002) are developing
a geographical ontology, but it seems not to include ax-
ioms, only vocabulary. (A theory is an ontology in which
the meaning of the symbols is pinned down by axioms.)
Hobbs (Hobbs et al., 1999) is leading a team in build-
ing a more spatial ontology and theory in DAML. These
should be valuable resources for us.

12 Plans for Future Work
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999876891891892">
Rather than merely finding and displaying individual
places, we hope to introduce capabilities for dealing with
and manipulating data, obtained from online agents, for
collections of places. We could ask for differences, aver-
ages, and maximums, or compare figures from different
years. Results could be displayed in charts and tables.
Although GeoLogica may answer a question appropri-
ately, it is usually poor at explaining or defending its an-
swer. Yet its user may not wish to accept the answer
without question, particularly if the veracity of any of the
sources is in doubt. The proof of the theorem contains
a full explanation, but most people do not find logical
proofs easy to understand. We plan to develop a more
comprehensible explanation facility, in which an under-
standable explanation will be extracted from the proof,
just as the answer itself is now.
SNARK has facilities for temporal reasoning, includ-
ing date and time arithmetic and the relationships be-
tween temporal intervals. However, we have not yet
introduced time into the geospatial theory. Taking this
step will enable us to deal with changes, such as histor-
ical changes in the names and boundaries of countries,
changes in the environment, weather, and the movement
of populations and individuals.
So far we have been dealing with isolated questions,
but it may be more realistic to imagine an information-
seeking dialogue, in which the user of GeoLogica poses
a series of questions, each refining or elaborating on the
one before, and some providing new information to be
used in answering future questions.
We have added facilities for extracting information
from English text (TextPro), but we have not yet used this
in the geographical domain. Care must be observed be-
cause information obtained through information extrac-
tion is not so reliable as that obtained from other sources.
We are currently applying similar techniques to pro-
vide tools of interest to intelligence analysts.

13 Conclusion

<bodyText confidence="0.99399">
Automating question answering forces us to look closely
at the relationship between descriptions and places, and a
logical geospatial theory is an ideal arena for making this
relationship explicit.
