Abstract
An efficient decoding algorithm is a cru-
cial element of any statistical machine 
translation system. Some researchers have 
noted certain similarities between SMT 
decoding and the famous Traveling Sales-
man Problem; in particular (Knight, 1999) 
has shown that any TSP instance can be 
mapped to a sub-case of a word-based 
SMT model, demonstrating NP-hardness 
of the decoding task. In this paper, we fo-
cus on the reverse mapping, showing that 
any phrase-based SMT decoding problem 
can be directly reformulated as a TSP. The 
transformation is very natural, deepens our 
understanding of the decoding problem, 
and allows direct use of any of the pow-
erful existing TSP solvers for SMT de-
coding. We test our approach on three 
datasets, and compare a TSP-based de-
coder to the popular beam-search algo-
rithm. In all cases, our method provides 
competitive or better performance.
1 Introduction
Phrase-based systems (Koehn et al., 2003) are 
probably the most widespread class of Statistical 
Machine Translation systems, and arguably one of 
the most successful. They use aligned sequences 
of words, called biphrases, as building blocks for 
translations, and score alternative candidate trans-
lations for the same source sentence based on a 
log-linear model of the conditional probability of 
target sentences given the source sentence:
p(T, a15) = 1
ZS exp 1:Akhk(5, a, T)	(1)
k
where the hk are features, that is, functions of the 
source string 5, of the target string T, and of the

alignment a, where the alignment is a representa-
tion of the sequence of biphrases that where used 
in order to build T from 5; The �k’s are weights 
and ZS is a normalization factor that guarantees 
that p is a proper conditional probability distri-
bution over the pairs (T, A). Some features are 
local, i.e. decompose over biphrases and can be 
precomputed and stored in advance. These typ-
ically include forward and reverse phrase condi-
tional probability features log p(�t1s) as well as 
logp(s1�t), where 9 is the source side of the 
biphrase and t� the target side, and the so-called 
“phrase penalty” and “word penalty” features, 
which count the number of phrases and words in 
the alignment. Other features are non-local, i.e. 
depend on the order in which biphrases appear in 
the alignment. Typical non-local features include 
one or more n-gram language models as well as 
a distortion feature, measuring by how much the 
order of biphrases in the candidate translation de-
viates from their order in the source sentence.
Given such a model, where the �Z’s have been 
tuned on a development set in order to minimize 
some error rate (see e.g. (Lopez, 2008)), together 
with a library of biphrases extracted from some 
large training corpus, a decoder implements the 
actual search among alternative translations:
(a*, T*) = arg max
(a,T)
The decoding problem (2) is a discrete optimiza-
tion problem. Usually, it is very hard to find the 
exact optimum and, therefore, an approximate so-
lution is used. Currently, most decoders are based 
on some variant of a heuristic left-to-right search, 
that is, they attempt to build a candidate translation 
(a, T) incrementally, from left to right, extending 
the current partial translation at each step with a 
new biphrase, and computing a score composed of 
two contributions: one for the known elements of 
the partial translation so far, and one a heuristic
P(T, a15).	(2)

estimate of the remaining cost for completing the 
translation. The variant which is mostly used is 
a form of beam-search, where several partial can-
didates are maintained in parallel, and candidates 
for which the current score is too low are pruned 
in favor of candidates that are more promising.
We will see in the next section that some char-
acteristics of beam-search make it a suboptimal 
choice for phrase-based decoding, and we will 
propose an alternative. This alternative is based on 
the observation that phrase-based decoding can be 
very naturally cast as a Traveling Salesman Prob-
lem (TSP), one of the best studied problems in 
combinatorial optimization. We will show that this 
formulation is not only a powerful conceptual de-
vice for reasoning on decoding, but is also prac-
tically convenient: in the same amount of time, 
off-the-shelf TSP solvers can find higher scoring 
solutions than the state-of-the art beam-search de-
coder implemented in Moses (Hoang and Koehn, 
2008).

Beam-search decoding
In beam-search decoding, candidate translation 
prefixes are iteratively extended with new phrases. 
In its most widespread variant, stack decoding, 
prefixes obtained by consuming the same number 
of source words, no matter which, are grouped to-
gether in the same stack1 and compete against one 
another. Threshold and histogram pruning are ap-
plied: the former consists in dropping all prefixes 
having a score lesser than the best score by more 
than some fixed amount (a parameter of the algo-
rithm), the latter consists in dropping all prefixes 
below a certain rank.
While quite successful in practice, stack decod-
ing presents some shortcomings. A first one is that 
prefixes obtained by translating different subsets 
of source words compete against one another. In 
one early formulation of stack decoding for SMT 
(Germann et al., 2001), the authors indeed pro-
posed to lazily create one stack for each subset 
of source words, but acknowledged issues with 
the potential combinatorial explosion in the num-
ber of stacks. This problem is reduced by the use 
of heuristics for estimating the cost of translating 
the remaining part of the source sentence. How-
1While commonly adopted in the speech and SMT com-
munities, this is a bit of a misnomer, since the used data struc-
tures are priority queues, not stacks. 
ever, this solution is only partially satisfactory. On 
the one hand, heuristics should be computationally 
light, much lighter than computing the actual best 
score itself, while, on the other hand, the heuris-
tics should be tight, as otherwise pruning errors 
will ensue. There is no clear criterion to guide 
in this trade-off. Even when good heuristics are 
available, the decoder will show a bias towards 
putting at the beginning the translation of a certain 
portion of the source, either because this portion 
is less ambiguous (i.e. its translation has larger 
conditional probability) or because the associated 
heuristics is less tight, hence more optimistic. Fi-
nally, since the translation is built left-to-right the 
decoder cannot optimize the search by taking ad-
vantage of highly unambiguous and informative 
portions that should be best translated far from the 
beginning. All these reasons motivate considering 
alternative decoding strategies.
Word-based SMT and the TSP
As already mentioned, the similarity between 
SMT decoding and TSP was recognized in 
(Knight, 1999), who focussed on showing that 
any TSP can be reformulated as a sub-class of the 
SMT decoding problem, proving that SMT decod-
ing is NP-hard. Following this work, the exis-
tence of many efficient TSP algorithms then in-
spired certain adaptations of the underlying tech-
niques to SMT decoding for word-based models. 
Thus, (Germann et al., 2001) adapt a TSP sub- 
tour elimination strategy to an IBM-4 model, us-
ing generic Integer Programming techniques. The 
paper comes close to a TSP formulation of de-
coding with IBM-4 models, but does not pursue 
this route to the end, stating that “It is difficult 
to convert decoding into straight TSP, but a wide 
range of combinatorial optimization problems (in-
cluding TSP) can be expressed in the more gen-
eral framework of linear integer programming”. 
By employing generic IP techniques, it is how-
ever impossible to rely on the variety of more 
efficient both exact and approximate approaches 
which have been designed specifically for the TSP. 
In (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) and (Tillmann, 2006), 
the authors modify a certain Dynamic Program-
ming technique used for TSP for use with an IBM- 
4 word-based model and a phrase-based model re-
spectively. However, to our knowledge, none of 
these works has proposed a direct reformulation 
of these SMT models as TSP instances. We be-
lieve we are the first to do so, working in our case
334
with the mainstream phrase-based SMT models, 
and therefore making it possible to directly apply 
existing TSP solvers to SMT.
3 The Traveling Salesman Problem and 
its variants
In this paper the Traveling Salesman Problem ap-
pears in four variants:
STSP. The most standard, and most studied, 
variant is the Symmetric TSP: we are given a non- 
directed graph G on N nodes, where the edges 
carry real-valued costs. The STSP problem con-
sists in finding a tour of minimal total cost, where 
a tour (also called Hamiltonian Circuit) is a “cir-
cular” sequence of nodes visiting each node of the 
graph exactly once;
ATSP. The Asymmetric TSP, or ATSP, is a vari-
ant where the underlying graph G is directed and 
where, for i and j two nodes of the graph, the 
edges (i,j) and (j,i) may carry different costs.
SGTSP. The Symmetric Generalized TSP, or 
SGTSP: given a non-oriented graph G of JGJ 
nodes with edges carrying real-valued costs, given 
a partition of these JGJ nodes into m non-empty, 
disjoint, subsets (called clusters), find a circular 
sequence of m nodes of minimal total cost, where 
each cluster is visited exactly once.
AGTSP. The Asymmetric Generalized TSP, or 
AGTSP: similar to the SGTSP, but G is now a di-
rected graph.
The STSP is often simply denoted TSP in the 
literature, and is known to be NP-hard (Applegate 
et al., 2007); however there has been enormous 
interest in developing efficient solvers for it, both 
exact and approximate.
Most of existing algorithms are designed for 
STSP, but ATSP, SGTSP and AGTSP may be re-
duced to STSP, and therefore solved by STSP al-
gorithms.
3.1 Reductions AGTSP—*ATSP—*STSP
The transformation of the AGTSP into the ATSP, 
introduced by (Noon and Bean, 1993)), is illus-
trated in Figure (1). In this diagram, we assume 
that Y1, ... , YK are the nodes of a given cluster, 
while X and Z are arbitrary nodes belonging to 
other clusters. In the transformed graph, we in-
troduce edges between the Y�’s in order to form a 
cycle as shown in the figure, where each edge has 
a large negative cost —K. We leave alone the in-
coming edge to Y� from X, but the outgoing edge
Figure 1: AGTSP—*ATSP.
from Y� to X has its origin changed to Y�_1. A 
feasible tour in the original AGTSP problem pass-
ing through X, Y�, Z will then be “encoded” as a 
tour of the transformed graph that first traverses 
X , then traverses Y�, ... , YK, ... , Y�_1, then tra-
verses Z (this encoding will have the same cost as 
the original cost, minus (k — 1)K). Crucially, if 
K is large enough, then the solver for the trans-
formed ATSP graph will tend to traverse as many 
K edges as possible, meaning that it will traverse 
exactly k — 1 such edges in the cluster, that is, it 
will produce an encoding of some feasible tour of 
the AGTSP problem.
As for the transformation ATSP—*STSP, several 
variants are described in the literature, e.g. (Ap-
plegate et al., 2007, p. 126); the one we use is from 
(Wikipedia, 2009) (not illustrated here for lack of 
space).
3.2 TSP algorithms
TSP is one of the most studied problems in com-
binatorial optimization, and even a brief review of 
existing approaches would take too much place. 
Interested readers may consult (Applegate et al., 
2007; Gutin, 2003) for good introductions.
One of the best existing TSP solvers is imple-
mented in the open source Concorde package (Ap-
plegate et al., 2005). Concorde includes the fastest 
exact algorithm and one of the most efficient im-
plementations of the Lin-Kernighan (LK) heuris-
tic for finding an approximate solution. LK works 
by generating an initial random feasible solution 
for the TSP problem, and then repeatedly identi-
fying an ordered subset of k edges in the current 
tour and an ordered subset of k edges not included 
in the tour such that when they are swapped the 
objective function is improved. This is somewhat
335
reminiscent of the Greedy decoding of (Germann 
et al., 2001), but in LK several transformations can 
be applied simultaneously, so that the risk of being 
stuck in a local optimum is reduced (Applegate et 
al., 2007, chapter 15).
As will be shown in the next section, phrase- 
based SMT decoding can be directly reformulated 
as an AGTSP. Here we use Concorde through 
first transforming AGTSP into STSP, but it might 
also be interesting in the future to use algorithms 
specifically designed for AGTSP, which could im-
prove efficiency further (see Conclusion).
4 Phrase-based Decoding as TSP
In this section we reformulate the SMT decoding 
problem as an AGTSP. We will illustrate the ap-
proach through a simple example: translating the 
French sentence “cette traduction automatique est 
curieuse ” into English. We assume that the rele-
vant biphrases for translating the sentence are as 
follows:
ID
source
target
h
cette
this
t
traduction
translation
ht
cette traduction
this translation
mt
traduction automatique
machine translation
a
automatique
automatic
m
automatique
machine
i
est
is
s
curieuse
strange
c
curieuse
curious
Under this model, we can produce, among others, 
the following translations:
h mt i s	this machine translation is strange
h c t i a	this curious translation is automatic
ht s i a	this translation strange is automatic
where we have indicated on the left the ordered se-
quence of biphrases that leads to each translation.
We now formulate decoding as an AGTSP, in 
the following way. The graph nodes are all the 
possible pairs (w, b), where w is a source word in 
the source sentence s and b is a biphrase contain-
ing this source word. The graph clusters are the 
subsets of the graph nodes that share a common 
source word w.
The costs of a transition between nodes M and 
N of the graph are defined as follows:
(a) If M is of the form (w, b) and N of the form 
(w&apos;, b), in which b is a single biphrase, and w and
w&apos; are consecutive words in b, then the transition 
cost is 0: once we commit to using the first word 
of b, there is no additional cost for traversing the
other source words covered by b.
(b) If M = (w, b), where w is the rightmost 
source word in the biphrase b, and N = (w&apos;, b&apos;), 
where w&apos; =� w is the leftmost source word in b&apos;, 
then the transition cost corresponds to the cost 
of selecting b&apos; just after b; this will correspond 
to “consuming” the source side of b&apos; after having 
consumed the source side of b (whatever their rel-
ative positions in the source sentence), and to pro-
ducing the target side of b&apos; directly after the target 
side of b; the transition cost is then the addition of 
several contributions (weighted by their respective 
A (not shown), as in equation 1):
•	The cost associated with the features local to 
b in the biphrase library;
•	The “distortion” cost of consuming the 
source word w&apos; just after the source word w:
1pos(w&apos;) — pos(w) — 11, where pos(w) and
pos(w&apos;) are the positions of w and w&apos; in the 
source sentence.
•	The language model cost of producing the 
target words of b&apos; right after the target words 
of b; with a bigram language model, this cost 
can be precomputed directly from b and b&apos;. 
This restriction to bigram models will be re-
moved in Section 4.1.
(c) In all other cases, the transition cost is infinite, 
or, in other words, there is no edge in the graph 
between M and N.
A special cluster containing a single node (de-
noted by $-$$ in the figures), and corresponding to 
special beginning-of-sentence symbols must also 
be included: the corresponding edges and weights 
can be worked out easily. Figures 2 and 3 give 
some illustrations of what we have just described.
4.1 From Bigram to N-gram LM
Successful phrase-based systems typically employ 
language models of order higher than two. How-
ever, our models so far have the following impor-
tant “Markovian” property: the cost of a path is 
additive relative to the costs of transitions. For 
example, in the example of Figure 3, the cost of 
this • machine translation • is • strange, can only 
take into account the conditional probability of the 
word strange relative to the word is, but not rela-
tive to the words translation and is. If we want to 
extend the power of the model to general n-gram 
language models, and in particular to the 3-gram

edges entering or exiting the node traduction — mt 
are shown. The only successor to [traduction —

case (on which we concentrate here, but the tech-
niques can be easily extended to the general case), 
the following approach can be applied.
Compiling Out for Trigram models
This approach consists in “compiling out” all 
biphrases with a target side of only one word. 
We replace each biphrase b with single-word tar-
get side by “extended” biphrases bi, ... , br, which 
are “concatenations” of b and some other biphrase
b� in the library.2 To give an example, consider
that we: (1) remove from the biphrase library the 
biphrase i, which has a single word target, and (2) 
add to the library the extended biphrases mti, ti, 
si, ..., that is, all the extended biphrases consist-
ing of the concatenation of a biphrase in the library 
with i, then it is clear that these extended biphrases 
will provide enough context to compute a trigram 
probability for the target word produced immedi-
ately next (in the examples, for the words strange,
2In the figures, such “concatenations” are denoted by 
[b&apos; • b] ; they are interpreted as encapsulations of first con-
suming the source side of b&apos;, whether or not this source side 
precedes the source side of b in the source sentence, produc-
ing the target side of b&apos;, consuming the source side of b, and 
producing the target side of b immediately after that of b&apos;.

automatic and automatic respectively). If we do 
that exhaustively for all biphrases (relevant for the 
source sentence at hand) that, like i, have a single- 
word target, we will obtain a representation that 
allows a trigram language model to be computed 
at each point.
The situation becomes clearer by looking at Fig-
ure 4, where we have only eliminated the biphrase 
i, and only shown some of the extended biphrases 
that now encapsulate i, and where we show one 
valid circuit. Note that we are now able to as-
sociate with the edge connecting the two nodes 
(est, mti) and (curieuse, s) a trigram cost because 
mti provides a large enough target context.
While this exhaustive “compiling out” method 
works in principle, it has a serious defect: if for 
the sentence to be translated, there are m relevant 
biphrases, among which k have single-word tar-
gets, then we will create on the order of km ex-
tended biphrases, which may represent a signif-
icant overhead for the TSP solver, as soon as k 
is large relative to m, which is typically the case. 
The problem becomes even worse if we extend the 
compiling-out method to n-gram language models 
with n &gt; 3. In the Future Work section below, 
we describe a powerful approach for circumvent-
ing this problem, but with which we have not ex-
perimented yet.

5.1 Monolingual word re-ordering
In the first series of experiments we consider the 
artificial task of reconstructing the original word 
order of a given English sentence. First, we ran-
domly permute words in the sentence, and then 
we try to reconstruct the original order by max-

the y axis corresponds to the mean difference (over all sentences) between the lm score of the output 
and the lm score of the reference normalized by the sentence length N: (LM(ref)-LM(true))/N. The solid 
line with star marks corresponds to using beam-search with different pruning thresholds, which result in 
different processing times and performances. The cross corresponds to using the exact-TSP decoder (in 
this case the time to the optimal solution is not under the user’s control).
imizing the LM score over all possible permuta-
tions. The reconstruction procedure may be seen 
as a translation problem from “Bad English” to 
“Good English”. Usually the LM score is used 
as one component of a more complex decoder 
score which also includes biphrase and distortion 
scores. But in this particular “translation task” 
from bad to good English, we consider that all
“biphrases” are of the form e — e, where e is an
English word, and we do not take into account 
any distortion: we only consider the quality of 
the permutation as it is measured by the LM com-
ponent. Since for each “source word” e, there is
exactly one possible “biphrase” e — e each clus-
ter of the Generalized TSP representation of the 
decoding problem contains exactly one node; in 
other terms, the Generalized TSP in this situation 
is simply a standard TSP. Since the decoding phase 
is then equivalent to a word reordering, the LM 
score may be used to compare the performance 
of different decoding algorithms. Here, we com-
pare three different algorithms: classical beam- 
search (Moses); a decoder based on an exact TSP 
solver (Concorde); a decoder based on an approx-
imate TSP solver (Lin-Kernighan as implemented 
in the Concorde solver) 3. In the Beam-search 
and the LK-based TSP solver we can control the 
trade-off between approximation quality and run-
ning time. To measure re-ordering quality, we use 
two scores. The first one is just the “internal” LM 
score; since all three algorithms attempt to maxi-
mize this score, a natural evaluation procedure is 
to plot its value versus the elapsed time. The sec-
3 Both TSP decoders may be used with/or without a distor-
tion limit; in our experiments we do not use this parameter. 
ond score is BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), com-
puted between the reconstructed and the original 
sentences, which allows us to check how well the 
quality of reconstruction correlates with the inter-
nal score. The training dataset for learning the LM 
consists of 50000 sentences from NewsCommen-
tary corpus (Callison-Burch et al., 2008), the test 
dataset for word reordering consists of 170 sen-
tences, the average length of test sentences is equal 
to 17 words.
Bigram based reordering. First we consider 
a bigram Language Model and the algorithms try 
to find the re-ordering that maximizes the LM 
score. The TSP solver used here is exact, that is, 
it actually finds the optimal tour. Figures 5(a,b) 
present the performance of the TSP and Beam- 
search based methods.
Trigram based reordering. Then we consider 
a trigram based Language Model and the algo-
rithms again try to maximize the LM score. The 
trigram model used is a variant of the exhaustive 
compiling-out procedure described in Section 4.1. 
Again, we use an exact TSP solver.
Looking at Figure 5a, we see a somewhat sur-
prising fact: the cross and some star points have 
positive y coordinates! This means that, when us-
ing a bigram language model, it is often possible 
to reorder the words of a randomly permuted ref-
erence sentence in such a way that the LM score 
of the reordered sentence is larger than the LM of 
the reference. A second notable point is that the 
increase in the LM-score of the beam-search with 
time is steady but very slow, and never reaches the 
level of performance obtained with the exact-TSP 
procedure, even when increasing the time by sev-
338
eral orders of magnitude. Also to be noted is that 
the solution obtained by the exact-TSP is provably 
the optimum, which is almost never the case of 
the beam-search procedure. In Figure 5b, we re-
port the BLEU score of the reordered sentences 
in the test set relative to the original reference 
sentences. Here we see that the exact-TSP out-
puts are closer to the references in terms of BLEU 
than the beam-search solutions. Although the TSP 
output does not recover the reference sentences 
(it produces sentences with a slightly higher LM 
score than the references), it does reconstruct the 
references better than the beam-search. The ex-
periments with trigram language models (Figures 
5(c,d)) show similar trends to those with bigrams.
5.2 Translation experiments with a bigram 
language model
In this section we consider two real translation 
tasks, namely, translation from English to French, 
trained on Europarl (Koehn et al., 2003) and trans-
lation from German to Spanish training on the 
NewsCommentary corpus. For Europarl, the train-
ing set includes 2.81 million sentences, and the 
test set 500. For NewsCommentary the training 
set is smaller: around 63k sentences, with a test 
set of 500 sentences. Figure 6 presents Decoder 
and Bleu scores as functions of time for the two 
corpuses.
Since in the real translation task, the size of the 
TSP graph is much larger than in the artificial re-
ordering task (in our experiments the median size 
of the TSP graph was around 400 nodes, some-
times growing up to 2000 nodes), directly apply-
ing the exact TSP solver would take too long; in-
stead we use the approximate LK algorithm and 
compare it to Beam-Search. The efficiency of the 
LK algorithm can be significantly increased by us-
ing a good initialization. To compare the quality of 
the LK and Beam-Search methods we take a rough 
initial solution produced by the Beam-Search al-
gorithm using a small value for the stack size and 
then use it as initial point, both for the LK algo-
rithm and for further Beam-Search optimization 
(where as before we vary the Beam-Search thresh-
olds in order to trade quality for time).
In the case of the Europarl corpus, we observe 
that LK outperforms Beam-Search in terms of the 
Decoder score as well as in terms of the BLEU 
score. Note that the difference between the two al-
gorithms increases steeply at the beginning, which 
means that we can significantly increase the qual-
ity of the Beam-Search solution by using the LK 
algorithm at a very small price. In addition, it is 
important to note that the BLEU scores obtained in 
these experiments correspond to feature weights, 
in the log-linear model (1), that have been opti-
mized for the Moses decoder, but not for the TSP 
decoder: optimizing these parameters relatively to 
the TSP decoder could improve its BLEU scores 
still further.
On the News corpus, again, LK outperforms 
Beam-Search in terms of the Decoder score. The 
situation with the BLEU score is more confuse. 
Both algorithms do not show any clear score im-
provement with increasing running time which 
suggests that the decoder’s objective function is 
not very well correlated with the BLEU score on 
this corpus.
6 Future Work
In section 4.1, we described a general “compiling 
out” method for extending our TSP representation 
to handling trigram and N-gram language models, 
but we noted that the method may lead to combi-
natorial explosion of the TSP graph. While this 
problem was manageable for the artificial mono-
lingual word re-ordering (which had only one pos-
sible translation for each source word), it be-
comes unwieldy for the real translation experi-
ments, which is why in this paper we only consid-
ered bigram LMs for these experiments. However, 
we know how to handle this problem in principle, 
and we now describe a method that we plan to ex-
periment with in the future.
To avoid the large number of artificial biphrases 
as in 4. 1, we perform an adaptive selection. Let us 
suppose that (w, b) is a SMT decoding graph node, 
where b is a biphrase containing only one word on 
the target side. On the first step, when we evaluate 
the traveling cost from (w, b) to (w&apos;, b&apos;), we take 
the language model component equal to
— log p(b&apos;.vIb.e, b&apos;&apos;. e),
where b&apos;.v represents the first word of the b&apos; tar-
get side, b. e is the only word of the b target
side, and b&apos;&apos;.e is the last word of the b&apos;&apos; tar 
get size. This procedure underestimates the total 
cost of tour passing through biphrases that have a 
single-word target. Therefore if the optimal tour 
passes only through biphrases with more than one

word on their target side, then we are sure that 
this tour is also optimal in terms of the tri-gram 
language model. Otherwise, if the optimal tour
passes through (w, b), where b is a biphrase hav-
ing a single-word target, we add only the extended 
biphrases related to b as we described in section 
4. 1, and then we recompute the optimal tour. Iter-
ating this procedure provably converges to an op-
timal solution.
This powerful method, which was proposed in 
(Kam and Kopec, 1996; Popat et al., 2001) in the 
context of a finite-state model (but not of TSP), 
can be easily extended to N-gram situations, and 
typically converges in a small number of itera-
tions.
7 Conclusion
The main contribution of this paper has been to 
propose a transformation for an arbitrary phrase- 
based SMT decoding instance into a TSP instance. 
While certain similarities of SMT decoding and 
TSP were already pointed out in (Knight, 1999), 
where it was shown that any Traveling Salesman 
Problem may be reformulated as an instance of 
a (simplistic) SMT decoding task, and while cer-
tain techniques used for TSP were then adapted to 
word-based SMT decoding (Germann et al., 2001; 
Tillmann and Ney, 2003; Tillmann, 2006), we are 
not aware of any previous work that shows that 
SMT decoding can be directly reformulated as a 
TSP. Beside the general interest of this transfor-
mation for understanding decoding, it also opens 
the door to direct application of the variety of ex-
isting TSP algorithms to SMT. Our experiments 
on synthetic and real data show that fast TSP al-
gorithms can handle selection and reordering in
SMT comparably or better than the state-of-the- 
art beam-search strategy, converging on solutions 
with higher objective function in a shorter time.
The proposed method proceeds by first con-
structing an AGTSP instance from the decoding 
problem, and then converting this instance first 
into ATSP and finally into STSP. At this point, a 
direct application of the well known STSP solver 
Concorde (with Lin-Kernighan heuristic) already 
gives good results. We believe however that there 
might exist even more efficient alternatives. In-
stead of converting the AGTSP instance into a 
STSP instance, it might prove better to use di-
rectly algorithms expressly designed for ATSP 
or AGTSP. For instance, some of the algorithms 
tested in the context of the DIMACS implemen-
tation challenge for ATSP (Johnson et al., 2002) 
might well prove superior. There is also active re-
search around AGTSP algorithms. Recently new 
effective methods based on a “memetic” strategy 
(Buriol et al., 2004; Gutin et al., 2008) have been 
put forward. These methods combined with our 
proposed formulation provide ready-to-use SMT 
decoders, which it will be interesting to compare.
