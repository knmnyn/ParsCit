Abstract
The vast majority of work on word senses 
has relied on predefined sense invento-
ries and an annotation schema where each 
word instance is tagged with the best fit-
ting sense. This paper examines the case 
for a graded notion of word meaning in 
two experiments, one which uses WordNet 
senses in a graded fashion, contrasted with 
the “winner takes all” annotation, and one 
which asks annotators to judge the similar-
ity of two usages. We find that the graded 
responses correlate with annotations from 
previous datasets, but sense assignments 
are used in a way that weakens the case for 
clear cut sense boundaries. The responses 
from both experiments correlate with the 
overlap of paraphrases from the English 
lexical substitution task which bodes well 
for the use of substitutes as a proxy for 
word sense. This paper also provides two 
novel datasets which can be used for eval-
uating computational systems.
1 Introduction
The vast majority of work on word sense tag-
ging has assumed that predefined word senses 
from a dictionary are an adequate proxy for the 
task, although of course there are issues with 
this enterprise both in terms of cognitive valid-
ity (Hanks, 2000; Kilgarriff, 1997; Kilgarriff, 
2006) and adequacy for computational linguis-
tics applications (Kilgarriff, 2006). Furthermore, 
given a predefined list of senses, annotation efforts 
and computational approaches to word sense dis-
ambiguation (WSD) have usually assumed that one 
best fitting sense should be selected for each us-
age. While there is usually some allowance made
for multiple senses, this is typically not adopted by 
annotators or computational systems.
Research on the psychology of concepts (Mur-
phy, 2002; Hampton, 2007) shows that categories 
in the human mind are not simply sets with clear- 
cut boundaries: Some items are perceived as 
more typical than others (Rosch, 1975; Rosch and 
Mervis, 1975), and there are borderline cases on 
which people disagree more often, and on whose 
categorization they are more likely to change their 
minds (Hampton, 1979; McCloskey and Glucks-
berg, 1978). Word meanings are certainly related 
to mental concepts (Murphy, 2002). This raises 
the question of whether there is any such thing as 
the one appropriate sense for a given occurrence.
In this paper we will explore using graded re-
sponses for sense tagging within a novel annota-
tion paradigm. Modeling the annotation frame-
work after psycholinguistic experiments, we do 
not train annotators to conform to sense distinc-
tions; rather we assess individual differences by 
asking annotators to produce graded ratings in-
stead of making a binary choice. We perform two 
annotation studies. In the first one, referred to 
as WSsim (Word Sense Similarity), annotators 
give graded ratings on the applicability of Word- 
Net senses. In the second one, Usim (Usage Sim-
ilarity), annotators rate the similarity of pairs of 
occurrences (usages) of a common target word. 
Both studies explore whether users make use of 
a graded scale or persist in making binary deci-
sions even when there is the option for a graded 
response. The first study additionally tests to what 
extent the judgments on WordNet senses fall into 
clear-cut clusters, while the second study allows 
us to explore meaning similarity independently of 
any lexicon resource.

2 Related Work
Manual word sense assignment is difficult for 
human annotators (Krishnamurthy and Nicholls, 
2000). Reported inter-annotator agreement (ITA) 
for fine-grained word sense assignment tasks has 
ranged between 69% (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 
2000) for a lexical sample using the HECTOR dic-
tionary and 78.6.% using WordNet (Landes et al., 
1998) in all-words annotation. The use of more 
coarse-grained senses alleviates the problem: In 
OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006), an ITA of 90% is 
used as the criterion for the construction of coarse- 
grained sense distinctions. However, intriguingly, 
for some high-frequency lemmas such as leave 
this ITA threshold is not reached even after mul-
tiple re-partitionings of the semantic space (Chen 
and Palmer, 2009). Similarly, the performance 
of WSD systems clearly indicates that WSD is not 
easy unless one adopts a coarse-grained approach, 
and then systems tagging all words at best perform 
a few percentage points above the most frequent 
sense heuristic (Navigli et al., 2007). Good perfor-
mance on coarse-grained sense distinctions may 
be more useful in applications than poor perfor-
mance on fine-grained distinctions (Ide and Wilks, 
2006) but we do not know this yet and there is 
some evidence to the contrary (Stokoe, 2005).
Rather than focus on the granularity of clus-
ters, the approach we will take in this paper 
is to examine the phenomenon of word mean-
ing both with and without recourse to predefined 
senses by focusing on the similarity of uses of a 
word. Human subjects show excellent agreement 
on judging word similarity out of context (Ruben-
stein and Goodenough, 1965; Miller and Charles, 
1991), and human judgments have previously been 
used successfully to study synonymy and near- 
synonymy (Miller and Charles, 1991; Bybee and 
Eddington, 2006). We focus on polysemy rather 
than synonymy. Our aim will be to use WSsim 
to determine to what extent annotations form co-
hesive clusters. In principle, it should be possi-
ble to use existing sense-annotated data to explore 
this question: almost all sense annotation efforts 
have allowed annotators to assign multiple senses 
to a single occurrence, and the distribution of these 
sense labels should indicate whether annotators 
viewed the senses as disjoint or not. However, 
the percentage of markables that received multi-
ple sense labels in existing corpora is small, and it 
varies massively between corpora: In the SemCor 
corpus (Landes et al., 1998), only 0.3% of all 
markables received multiple sense labels. In the 
SENSEVAL-3 English lexical task corpus (Mihal-
cea et al., 2004) (hereafter referred to as SE-3), the 
ratio is much higher at 8% of all markables1. This 
could mean annotators feel that there is usually a 
single applicable sense, or it could point to a bias 
towards single-sense assignment in the annotation 
guidelines and/or the annotation tool. The WSsim 
experiment that we report in this paper is designed 
to eliminate such bias as far as possible and we 
conduct it on data taken from SemCor and SE-3 so 
that we can compare the annotations. Although we 
use WordNet for the annotation, our study is not a 
study of WordNet per se. We choose WordNet be-
cause it is sufficiently fine-grained to examine sub-
tle differences in usage, and because traditionally 
annotated datasets exist to which we can compare 
our results.
Predefined dictionaries and lexical resources are 
not the only possibilities for annotating lexical 
items with meaning. In cross-lingual settings, the 
actual translations of a word can be taken as the 
sense labels (Resnik and Yarowsky, 2000). Re-
cently, McCarthy and Navigli (2007) proposed 
the English Lexical Substitution task (hereafter 
referred to as LEXSUB) under the auspices of 
SemEval-2007. It uses paraphrases for words in 
context as a way of annotating meaning. The task 
was proposed following a background of discus-
sions in the WSD community as to the adequacy 
of predefined word senses. The LEXSUB dataset 
comprises open class words (nouns, verbs, adjec-
tives and adverbs) with token instances of each 
word appearing in the context of one sentence 
taken from the English Internet Corpus (Sharoff, 
2006). The methodology can only work where 
there are paraphrases, so the dataset only contains 
words with more than one meaning where at least 
two different meanings have near synonyms. For 
meanings without obvious substitutes the annota-
tors were allowed to use multiword paraphrases or 
words with slightly more general meanings. This 
dataset has been used to evaluate automatic sys-
tems which can find substitutes appropriate for the 
context. To the best of our knowledge there has 
been no study of how the data collected relates to 
word sense annotations or judgments of semantic 
similarity. In this paper we examine these relation-

ships by re-using data from LEXSUB in both new 
annotation experiments and testing the results for 
correlation.
3 Annotation
We conducted two experiments through an on-
line annotation interface. Three annotators partic-
ipated in each experiment; all were native British 
English speakers. The first experiment, WSsim, 
collected annotator judgments about the applica-
bility of dictionary senses using a 5-point rating 
scale. The second, Usim, also utilized a 5-point 
scale but collected judgments on the similarity in 
meaning between two uses of a word. 2 The scale 
was 1 – completely different, 2 – mostly different, 
3 – similar, 4 – very similar and 5 – identical. In 
Usim, this scale rated the similarity of the two uses 
of the common target word; in WSsim it rated the 
similarity between the use of the target word and 
the sense description. In both experiments, the an-
notation interface allowed annotators to revisit and 
change previously supplied judgments, and a com-
ment box was provided alongside each item.
WSsim. This experiment contained a total of 
430 sentences spanning 11 lemmas (nouns, verbs 
and adjectives). For 8 of these lemmas, 50 sen-
tences were included, 25 of them randomly sam-
pled from SemCor 3 and 25 randomly sampled 
from SE-3 .4 The remaining 3 lemmas in the ex-
periment each had 10 sentences taken from the 
LEXSUB data.
WSsim is a word sense annotation task using 
WordNet senses.5 Unlike previous word sense an-
notation projects, we asked annotators to provide 
judgments on the applicability of every WordNet 
sense of the target lemma with the instruction: 6
2Throughout this paper, a target word is assumed to be a 
word in a given PoS.
3The SemCor dataset was produced alongside WordNet, 
so it can be expected to support the WordNet sense distinc-
tions. The same cannot be said for SE-3.
4Sentence fragments and sentences with 5 or fewer words 
were excluded from the sampling. Annotators were given 
the sentences, but not the original annotation from these re-
sources.
5WordNet 1.7.1 was used in the annotation of both SE-3 
and SemCor; we used the more current WordNet 3.0 after 
verifying that the lemmas included in this experiment had the 
same senses listed in both versions. Care was taken addition-
ally to ensure that senses were not presented in an order that 
reflected their frequency of occurrence.

annotation
Your task is to rate, for each of these descriptions, 
how well they reflect the meaning of the boldfaced 
word in the sentence.
Applicability judgments were not binary, but were 
instead collected using the five-point scale given 
above which allowed annotators to indicate not 
only whether a given sense applied, but to what 
degree. Each annotator annotated each of the 430 
items. By having multiple annotators per item and 
a graded, non-binary annotation scheme we al-
low for and measure differences between annota-
tors, rather than training annotators to conform to 
a common sense distinction guideline. By asking 
annotators to provide ratings for each individual 
sense, we strive to eliminate all bias towards either 
single-sense or multiple-sense assignment. In tra-
ditional word sense annotation, such bias could be 
introduced directly through annotation guidelines 
or indirectly, through tools that make it easier to 
assign fewer senses. We focus not on finding the 
best fitting sense but collect judgments on the ap-
plicability of all senses.
Usim. This experiment used data from LEXSUB. 
For more information on LEXSUB, see McCarthy 
and Navigli (2007). 34 lemmas (nouns, verbs, ad-
jectives and adverbs) were manually selected, in-
cluding the 3 lemmas also used in WSsim. We se-
lected lemmas which exhibited a range of mean-
ings and substitutes in the LEXSUB data, with 
as few multiword substitutes as possible. Each 
lemma is the target in 10 LEXSUB sentences. For 
our experiment, we took every possible pairwise 
comparison of these 10 sentences for a lemma. We 
refer to each such pair of sentences as an SPAIR. 
The resulting dataset comprised 45 SPAIRs per 
lemma, adding up to 1530 comparisons per anno-
tator overall.
In this annotation experiment, annotators saw 
SPAIRs with a common target word and rated the 
similarity in meaning between the two uses of the 
target word with the instruction:
Your task is to rate, for each pair of sentences, how 
similar in meaning the two boldfaced words are on 
a five -point scale.
In addition annotators had the ability to respond 
with “Cannot Decide”, indicating that they were 
unable to make an effective comparison between 
the two contexts, for example because the mean-
ing of one usage was unclear. This occurred in 
9 paired occurrences during the course of anno-
tation, and these items (paired occurrences) were
12
excluded from further analysis.
The purpose of Usim was to collect judgments 
about degrees of similarity between a word’s 
meaning in different contexts. Unlike WSsim, 
Usim does not rely upon any dictionary resource 
as a basis for the judgments.
4 Analyses
This section reports on analyses on the annotated 
data. In all the analyses we use Spearman’s rank 
correlation coefficient (p), a nonparametric test, 
because the data does not seem to be normally 
distributed. We used two-tailed tests in all cases, 
rather than assume the direction of the relation-
ship. As noted above, we have three annotators 
per task, and each annotator gave judgments for 
every sentence (WSsim) or sentence pair (Usim). 
Since the annotators may vary as to how they use 
the ordinal scale, we do not use the mean of judg-
ments7 but report all individual correlations. All 
analyses were done using the R package.8
4.1 WSsim analysis
In the WSsim experiment, annotators rated the ap-
plicability of each WordNet 3.0 sense for a given 
target word occurrence. Table 1 shows a sample 
annotation for the target argument.n. 9
Pattern of annotation and annotator agree-
ment. Figure 1 shows how often each of the five 
judgments on the scale was used, individually and 
summed over all annotators. (The y-axis shows 
raw counts of each judgment.) We can see from 
this figure that the extreme ratings 1 and 5 are used 
more often than the intermediate ones, but annota-
tors make use of the full ordinal scale when judg-
ing the applicability of a sense. Also, the figure 
shows that annotator 1 used the extreme negative 
rating 1 much less than the other two annotators. 
Figure 2 shows the percentage of times each judg-
ment was used on senses of three lemmas, differ-
ent.a, interest.n, and win.v. In WordNet, they have 
5, 7, and 4 senses, respectively. The pattern for 
win.v resembles the overall distribution of judg-
ments, with peaks at the extreme ratings 1 and 5. 
The lemma interest.n has a single peak at rating 
1, partly due to the fact that senses 5 (financial

results in all the cases we tested.

judgments have been used with approximately the 
same frequency.
We measured the level of agreement between 
annotators using Spearman’s p between the judg-
ments of every pair of annotators. The pairwise 
correlations were p = 0.506, p = 0.466 and p = 
0.540, all highly significant with p &lt; 2.2e-16.

all of WSsim (third row). The Orig. column 
indicates how many items had multiple labels in 
the original annotation (SemCor or SE-3)10. Note 
that no item had more than one sense label in 
SemCor. The columns under WSsim judgment 
show the percentage of items (averaged over 
the three annotators) that had judgments at or 
above the specified threshold, starting from rating 
3 – similar. Within WSsim, the percentage of 
multiple assignments in the three rows is fairly 
constant. WSsim avoids the bias to one sense 
by deliberately asking for judgments on the 
applicability of each sense rather than asking 
annotators to find the best one.
To compute the Spearman’s correlation between 
the original sense labels and those given in the 
WSsim annotation, we converted SemCor and 
SE-3 labels to the format used within WSsim: As-
signed senses were converted to a judgment of 5, 
and unassigned senses to a judgment of 1. For the 
WSsim/SemCor dataset, the correlation between 
original and WSsim annotation was p = 0.234, 
p = 0.448, and p = 0.390 for the three anno-
tators, each highly significant with p &lt; 2.2e-16. 
For the WSsim/SE-3 dataset, the correlations were 
p = 0.346, p = 0.449 and p = 0.338, each of them 
again highly significant at p &lt; 2.2e-16.

WSsim task could be explained by more coarse- 
grained, categorial sense assignments. We first 
test how many pairs of senses for a given lemma 
show similar patterns in the ratings that they re-
ceive. Table 3 shows the percentage of sense pairs 
that were significantly correlated for each anno-
tator.11 Significantly positively correlated senses 
can possibly be reduced to more coarse-grained 
senses. Would annotators have been able to des-
ignate a single appropriate sense given these more 
coarse-grained senses? Call two senses groupable 
if they are significantly positively correlated; in or-
der not to overlook correlations that are relatively 
weak but existent, we use a cutoff of p = 0.05 for 
significant correlation. We tested how often anno-
tators gave ratings of at least similar, i.e. ratings 
&gt; 3, to senses that were not groupable. Table 4 
shows the percentages of items where at least two 
non-groupable senses received ratings at or above 
the specified threshold. The table shows that re-
gardless of which annotator we look at, over 40% 
of all items had two or more non-groupable senses 
receive judgments of at least 3 (similar). There
11 We exclude senses that received a uniform rating of 1 on 
all items. This concerned 4 senses for annotator 2 and 6 for 
annotator 3.

were even several items where two or more non-
groupable senses each got a judgment of 5. The 
sentence in table 1 is a case where several non-
groupable senses got ratings &gt; 3. This is most 
pronounced for Annotator 2, who along with sense 
2 (controversy) assigned senses 1 (statement), 7 
(line of reasoning), and 3 (debate), none of which 
are groupable with sense 2.
4.2 Usim analysis
In this experiment, ratings between 1 and 5 were 
given for every pairwise combination of sentences 
for each target lemma. An example of an SPAIR 
for charge.n is shown in figure 3. In this case the 
verdicts from the annotators were 2, 3 and 4.
Pattern of Annotations and Annotator Agree-
ment Figure 4 gives a bar chart of the judgments 
for each annotator and summed over annotators. 
We can see from this figure that the annotators 
use the full ordinal scale when judging the simi-
larity of a word’s usages, rather than sticking to 
the extremes. There is variation across words, de-
pending on the relatedness of each word’s usages. 
Figure 5 shows the judgments for the words bar.n, 
work.v and raw.a. We see that bar.n has predom-
inantly different usages with a peak for category 
1, work.v has more similar judgments (category 5) 
compared to any other category and raw.a has a 
peak in the middle category (3). 12 There are other 
words, like for example fresh.a, where the spread 
is more uniform.
To gauge the level of agreement between anno-
tators, we calculated Spearman’s p between the 
judgments of every pair of annotators as in sec-
tion 4.1. The pairwise correlations are all highly 
significant (p &lt; 2.2e-16) with Spearman’s p = 
0.502, 0.641 and 0.501 giving an average corre-
lation of 0.548. We also perform leave-one-out re- 
sampling following Lapata (2006) which gave us 
a Spearman’s correlation of 0.630.
12For figure 5 we sum the judgments over annotators.

judgment was used, by annotator and summed 
over all annotators

Comparison with LEXSUB substitutions Next 
we look at whether the Usim judgments on sen-
tence pairs (SPAIRs) correlate with LEXSUB sub-
stitutes. To do this we use the overlap of substi-
tutes provided by the five LEXSUB annotators be-
tween two sentences in an SPAIR. In LEXSUB the 
annotators had to replace each item (a target word 
within the context of a sentence) with a substitute 
that fitted the context. Each annotator was permit-
ted to supply up to three substitutes provided that 
they all fitted the context equally. There were 10 
sentences per lemma. For our analyses we take 
every SPAIR for a given lemma and calculate the 
overlap (inter) of the substitutes provided by the 
annotators for the two usages under scrutiny. Let 
s1 and s2 be a pair of sentences in an SPAIR and

x1 and x2 be the multisets of substitutes for the 
respective sentences. Let freq(w,x) be the fre-
quency of a substitute w in a multiset x of sub-
stitutes for a given sentence. 13 INTER(s1,s2) =
�wEx1f1x2 min (freq(w,x1), freq(w,x2))
max(1x1 1, 1x2 1)
Using this calculation for each SPAIR we can 
now compute the correlation between the Usim 
judgments for each annotator and the INTER val-
ues, again using Spearman’s. The figures are 
shown in the leftmost block of table 5. The av-
erage correlation for the 3 annotators was 0.488 
and the p-values were all &lt; 2.2e-16. This shows 
a highly significant correlation of the Usim judg-
ments and the overlap of substitutes.
We also compare the WSsim judgments against 
the LEXSUB substitutes, again using the INTER 
measure of substitute overlap. For this analysis, 
we only use those WSsim sentences that are origi-
nally from LEXSUB. In WSsim, the judgments for 
a sentence comprise judgments for each WordNet 
sense of that sentence. In order to compare against 
INTER, we need to transform these sentence-wise 
ratings in WSsim to a WSsim-based judgment of 
sentence similarity. To this end, we compute the 
Euclidean Distance14 (ED) between two vectors J1 
and J2 of judgments for two sentences s1, s2 for the 
same lemma E. Each of the n indexes of the vector 
represent one of the n different WordNet senses 
for E. The value at entry i of the vector J1 is the 
judgment that the annotator in question (we do not 
average over annotators here) provided for sense i 
of E for sentence s1.
(J1[i]—J2[i])2) (1)
We correlate the Euclidean distances with 
INTER. We can only test correlation for the subset 
of WSsim that overlaps with the LEXSUB data: the 
30 sentences for investigator.n, function.n and or-
der.v, which together give 135 unique SPAIRs. We 
refer to this subset as Wf1U. The results are given 
in the third block of table 5. Note that since we are 
measuring distance between SPAIRs for WSsim
13The frequency of a substitute in a multiset depends on 
the number of LEXSUB annotators that picked the substitute 
for this item.
14We use Euclidean Distance rather than a normalizing 
measure like Cosine because a sentence where all ratings are 
5 should be very different from a sentence where all senses 
received a rating of 1.

Table 5: Annotator correlation with LEXSUB sub-
stitute overlap (inter)
whereas INTER is a measure of similarity, the cor-
relation is negative. The results are highly signif-
icant with individual p-values from &lt; 1.067e-10 
to &lt; 1.551e-08 and a mean correlation of -0.495. 
The results in the first and third block of table 5 are 
not directly comparable, as the results in the first 
block are for all Usim data and not the subset of 
LEXSUB with WSsim annotations. We therefore 
repeated the analysis for Usim on the subset of 
data in WSsim and provide the correlation in the 
middle section of table 5. The mean correlation 
for Usim on this subset of the data is 0.532, which 
is a stronger relationship compared to WSsim, al-
though there is more discrepancy between individ-
ual annotators, with the result for annotator 4 giv-
ing a p-value = 9.139e-05 while the other two an-
notators had p-values &lt; 2.2e-16.
The LEXSUB substitute overlaps between dif-
ferent usages correlate well with both Usim and 
WSsim judgments, with a slightly stronger rela-
tionship to Usim, perhaps due to the more compli-
cated representation of word meaning in WSsim 
which uses the full set of WordNet senses.
4.3 Correlation between WSsim and Usim
As we showed in section 4.1, WSsim correlates 
with previous word sense annotations in SemCor 
and SE-3 while allowing the user a more graded 
response to sense tagging. As we saw in sec-
tion 4.2, Usim and WSsim judgments both have a 
highly significant correlation with similarity of us-
ages as measured using the overlap of substitutes 
from LEXSUB. Here, we look at the correlation 
of WSsim and Usim, considering again the sub-
set of data that is common to both experiments. 
We again transform WSsim sense judgments for 
individual sentences to distances between SPAIRs 
using Euclidean Distance (ED). The Spearman’s 
p range between —0.307 and —0.671, and all re-
sults are highly significant with p-values between 
0.0003 and &lt; 2.2e-16. As above, the correla-
tion is negative because ED is a distance measure 
between sentences in an SPAIR, whereas the judg-
ED(J1,J2) = V1(

i=1

ments for Usim are similarity judgments. We see 
that there is highly significant correlation for every 
pairing of annotators from the two experiments.
5 Discussion
Validity of annotation scheme. Annotator rat-
ings show highly significant correlation on both 
tasks. This shows that the tasks are well-defined. 
In addition, there is a strong correlation between 
WSsim and Usim, which indicates that the poten-
tial bias introduced by the use of dictionary senses 
in WSsim is not too prominent. However, we note 
that WSsim only contained a small portion of 3 
lemmas (30 sentences and 135 SPAIRs) in com-
mon with Usim, so more annotation is needed to 
be certain of this relationship. Given the differ-
ences between annotator 1 and the other annota-
tors in Fig. 1, it would be interesting to collect 
judgments for additional annotators.
Graded judgments of use similarity and sense 
applicability. The annotators made use of the 
full spectrum of ratings, as shown in Figures 1 and 
4. This may be because of a graded perception of 
the similarity of uses as well as senses, or because 
some uses and senses are very similar. Table 4 
shows that for a large number of WSsim items, 
multiple senses that were not significantly posi-
tively correlated got high ratings. This seems to 
indicate that the ratings we obtained cannot sim-
ply be explained by more coarse-grained senses. It 
may hence be reasonable to pursue computational 
models of word meaning that are graded, maybe 
even models that do not rely on dictionary senses 
at all (Erk and Pado, 2008).
Comparison to previous word sense annotation. 
Our graded WSsim annotations do correlate with 
traditional “best fitting sense” annotations from 
SemCor and SE-3; however, if annotators perceive 
similarity between uses and senses as graded, tra-
ditional word sense annotation runs the risk of in-
troducing bias into the annotation.
Comparison to lexical substitutions. There is a 
strong correlation between both Usim and WSsim 
and the overlap in paraphrases that annotators gen-
erated for LEXSUB. This is very encouraging, and 
especially interesting because LEXSUB annotators 
freely generated paraphrases rather than selecting 
them from a list.
6 Conclusions
We have introduced a novel annotation paradigm 
for word sense annotation that allows for graded 
judgments and for some variation between anno-
tators. We have used this annotation paradigm 
in two experiments, WSsim and Usim, that shed 
some light on the question of whether differences 
between word usages are perceived as categorial 
or graded. Both datasets will be made publicly 
available. There was a high correlation between 
annotator judgments within and across tasks, as 
well as with previous word sense annotation and 
with paraphrases proposed in the English Lex-
ical Substitution task. Annotators made ample 
use of graded judgments in a way that cannot 
be explained through more coarse-grained senses. 
These results suggest that it may make sense to 
evaluate WSD systems on a task of graded rather 
than categorial meaning characterization, either 
through dictionary senses or similarity between 
uses. In that case, it would be useful to have more 
extensive datasets with graded annotation, even 
though this annotation paradigm is more time con-
suming and thus more expensive than traditional 
word sense annotation.
As a next step, we will automatically cluster the 
judgments we obtained in the WSsim and Usim 
experiments to further explore the degree to which 
the annotation gives rise to sense grouping. We 
will also use the ratings in both experiments to 
evaluate automatically induced models of word 
meaning. The SemEval-2007 word sense induc-
tion task (Agirre and Soroa, 2007) already allows 
for evaluation of automatic sense induction sys-
tems, but compares output to gold-standard senses 
from OntoNotes. We hope that the Usim dataset 
will be particularly useful for evaluating methods 
which relate usages without necessarily producing 
hard clusters. Also, we will extend the current 
dataset using more annotators and exploring ad-
ditional lexicon resources.
