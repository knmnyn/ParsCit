Abstract
We address the issue of using heteroge-
neous treebanks for parsing by breaking 
it down into two sub-problems, convert-
ing grammar formalisms of the treebanks 
to the same one, and parsing on these 
homogeneous treebanks. First we pro-
pose to employ an iteratively trained tar-
get grammar parser to perform grammar 
formalism conversion, eliminating prede-
fined heuristic rules as required in previ-
ous methods. Then we provide two strate-
gies to refine conversion results, and adopt 
a corpus weighting technique for parsing 
on homogeneous treebanks. Results on the 
Penn Treebank show that our conversion 
method achieves 42% error reduction over 
the previous best result. Evaluation on 
the Penn Chinese Treebank indicates that a 
converted dependency treebank helps con-
stituency parsing and the use of unlabeled 
data by self-training further increases pars-
ing f-score to 85.2%, resulting in 6% error 
reduction over the previous best result.
1 Introduction
The last few decades have seen the emergence of 
multiple treebanks annotated with different gram-
mar formalisms, motivated by the diversity of lan-
guages and linguistic theories, which is crucial to 
the success of statistical parsing (Abeille et al., 
2000; Brants et al., 1999; Bohmova et al., 2003; 
Han et al., 2002; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998; 
Marcus et al., 1993; Moreno et al., 2003; Xue et 
al., 2005). Availability of multiple treebanks cre-
ates a scenario where we have a treebank anno-
tated with one grammar formalism, and another 
treebank annotated with another grammar formal-
ism that we are interested in. We call the first
a source treebank, and the second a target tree- 
bank. We thus encounter a problem of how to 
use these heterogeneous treebanks for target gram-
mar parsing. Here heterogeneous treebanks refer 
to two or more treebanks with different grammar 
formalisms, e.g., one treebank annotated with de-
pendency structure (DS) and the other annotated 
with phrase structure (PS).
It is important to acquire additional labeled data 
for the target grammar parsing through exploita-
tion of existing source treebanks since there is of-
ten a shortage of labeled data. However, to our 
knowledge, there is no previous study on this is-
sue.
Recently there have been some works on us-
ing multiple treebanks for domain adaptation of 
parsers, where these treebanks have the same 
grammar formalism (McClosky et al., 2006b; 
Roark and Bacchiani, 2003). Other related works 
focus on converting one grammar formalism of a 
treebank to another and then conducting studies on 
the converted treebank (Collins et al., 1999; Forst, 
2003; Wang et al., 1994; Watkinson and Manand-
har, 2001). These works were done either on mul-
tiple treebanks with the same grammar formalism 
or on only one converted treebank. We see that 
their scenarios are different from ours as we work 
with multiple heterogeneous treebanks.
For the use of heterogeneous treebanks1, we 
propose a two-step solution: (1) converting the 
grammar formalism of the source treebank to the 
target one, (2) refining converted trees and using 
them as additional training data to build a target 
grammar parser.
For grammar formalism conversion, we choose 
the DS to PS direction for the convenience of the 
comparison with existing works (Xia and Palmer, 
2001; Xia et al., 2008). Specifically, we assume 
that the source grammar formalism is dependency

grammar, and the target grammar formalism is 
phrase structure grammar.
Previous methods for DS to PS conversion 
(Collins et al., 1999; Covington, 1994; Xia and 
Palmer, 2001; Xia et al., 2008) often rely on pre-
defined heuristic rules to eliminate converison am-
biguity, e.g., minimal projection for dependents, 
lowest attachment position for dependents, and the 
selection of conversion rules that add fewer num-
ber of nodes to the converted tree. In addition, the 
validity of these heuristic rules often depends on 
their target grammars. To eliminate the heuristic 
rules as required in previous methods, we propose 
to use an existing target grammar parser (trained 
on the target treebank) to generate N-best parses 
for each sentence in the source treebank as conver-
sion candidates, and then select the parse consis-
tent with the structure of the source tree as the con-
verted tree. Furthermore, we attempt to use con-
verted trees as additional training data to retrain 
the parser for better conversion candidates. The 
procedure of tree conversion and parser retraining 
will be run iteratively until a stopping condition is 
satisfied.
Since some converted trees might be imper-
fect from the perspective of the target grammar, 
we provide two strategies to refine conversion re-
sults: (1) pruning low-quality trees from the con-
verted treebank, (2) interpolating the scores from 
the source grammar and the target grammar to se-
lect better converted trees. Finally we adopt a cor-
pus weighting technique to get an optimal combi-
nation of the converted treebank and the existing 
target treebank for parser training.
We have evaluated our conversion algorithm on 
a dependency structure treebank (produced from 
the Penn Treebank) for comparison with previous 
work (Xia et al., 2008). We also have investi-
gated our two-step solution on two existing tree- 
banks, the Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue et 
al., 2005) and the Chinese Dependency Treebank 
(CDT)2 (Liu et al., 2006). Evaluation on WSJ data 
demonstrates that it is feasible to use a parser for 
grammar formalism conversion and the conversion 
benefits from converted trees used for parser re-
training. Our conversion method achieves 93.8% 
f-score on dependency trees produced from WSJ 
section 22, resulting in 42% error reduction over 
the previous best result for DS to PS conversion. 
Results on CTB show that score interpolation is

more effective than instance pruning for the use 
of converted treebanks for parsing and converted 
CDT helps parsing on CTB. When coupled with 
self-training technique, a reranking parser with 
CTB and converted CDT as labeled data achieves 
85.2% f-score on CTB test set, an absolute 1.0% 
improvement (6% error reduction) over the previ-
ous best result for Chinese parsing.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2, we first describe a parser based method 
for DS to PS conversion, and then we discuss pos-
sible strategies to refine conversion results, and 
finally we adopt the corpus weighting technique 
for parsing on homogeneous treebanks. Section 
3 provides experimental results of grammar for-
malism conversion on a dependency treebank pro-
duced from the Penn Treebank. In Section 4, we 
evaluate our two-step solution on two existing het-
erogeneous Chinese treebanks. Section 5 reviews 
related work and Section 6 concludes this work.
2 Our Two-Step Solution
2.1 Grammar Formalism Conversion
Previous DS to PS conversion methods built a 
converted tree by iteratively attaching nodes and 
edges to the tree with the help of conversion 
rules and heuristic rules, based on current head- 
dependent pair from a source dependency tree and 
the structure of the built tree (Collins et al., 1999; 
Covington, 1994; Xia and Palmer, 2001; Xia et 
al., 2008). Some observations can be made on 
these methods: (1) for each head-dependent pair, 
only one locally optimal conversion was kept dur-
ing tree-building process, at the risk of pruning 
globally optimal conversions, (2) heuristic rules 
are required to deal with the problem that one 
head-dependent pair might have multiple conver-
sion candidates, and these heuristic rules are usu-
ally hand-crafted to reflect the structural prefer-
ence in their target grammars. To overcome these 
limitations, we propose to employ a parser to gen-
erate N-best parses as conversion candidates and 
then use the structural information of source trees 
to select the best parse as a converted tree.
We formulate our conversion method as fol-
lows.
Let CDS be a source treebank annotated with 
DS and CPS be a target treebank annotated with 
PS. Our goal is to convert the grammar formalism 
of CDS to that of CPS.
We first train a constituency parser on CPS

Input: CPS, CDS, Q, and a constituency parser	Output: Converted trees Cps
1. Initialize:
— Set Cps,0 as null, DevScore=0, q=0;
— Split CPS into training set CPS,train and development set CPS,dev;
— Train the parser on CPS,train and denote it by Pq–l;
2. Repeat:
— Use Pq_i to generate N-best PS parses for each sentence in CDS, and convert PS to DS for each parse; 
— For each sentence in CDS Do
o �t=argmaxt Score (xi,t), and select the �t-th parse as a converted tree for this sentence; 
— Let CD S,q S represent these converted trees, and let Ctrain=CPS,train U CDSS,q ;
— Train the parser on Ctrain, and denote the updated parser by Pq;
— Let DevScoreq be the f-score of Pq on CPS,dev;
— If DevScoreq &gt; DevScore Then DevScore=DevScoreq, and Cps=Cps,q;
— Else break;
— q++;

(90% trees in CPS as training set CPS,train, and 
other trees as development set CPS,dev) and then 
let the parser generate N-best parses for each sen-
tence in CDS.
Let n be the number of sentences (or trees) in 
CDS and ni be the number of N-best parses gen-
erated by the parser for the i-th (1 &lt; i &lt; n) sen-
tence in CDS. Let xi,t be the t-th (1 &lt; t &lt; ni) 
parse for the i-th sentence. Let yi be the tree of the 
i-th (1 &lt; i &lt; n) sentence in CDS.
To evaluate the quality of xi,t as a conversion 
candidate for yi, we convert xi,t to a dependency 
tree (denoted as xDS) and then use unlabeled de-
pendency f-score to measure the similarity be-
tween xDS and yi. Let Score(xi,t) denote the 
unlabeled dependency f-score of xDS against yi. 
Then we determine the converted tree for yi by 
maximizing Score(xi,t) over the N-best parses.
The conversion from PS to DS works as fol-
lows:
Step 1. Use a head percolation table to find the 
head of each constituent in xi,t.
Step 2. Make the head of each non-head child 
depend on the head of the head child for each con-
stituent.
Unlabeled dependency f-score is a harmonic 
mean of unlabeled dependency precision and unla-
beled dependency recall. Precision measures how
many head-dependent word pairs found in xDS
i,t
are correct and recall is the percentage of head- 
dependent word pairs defined in the gold-standard
tree that are found in xDS. Here we do not take 
dependency tags into consideration for evaluation 
since they cannot be obtained without more so-
phisticated rules.
To improve the quality of N-best parses, we at-
tempt to use the converted trees as additional train-
ing data to retrain the parser. The procedure of 
tree conversion and parser retraining can be run it-
eratively until a termination condition is satisfied. 
Here we use the parser’s f-score on CPS,dev as a 
termination criterion. If the update of training data 
hurts the performance on CPS,dev, then we stop 
the iteration.
Table 1 shows this DS to PS conversion algo-
rithm. Q is an upper limit of the number of loops, 
and Q&gt;0.
2.2 Target Grammar Parsing
Through grammar formalism conversion, we have 
successfully turned the problem of using hetero-
geneous treebanks for parsing into the problem of 
parsing on homogeneous treebanks. Before using 
converted source treebank for parsing, we present 
two strategies to refine conversion results.
Instance Pruning For some sentences in 
CDS, the parser might fail to generate high qual-
ity N-best parses, resulting in inferior converted 
trees. To clean the converted treebank, we can re-
move the converted trees with low unlabeled de-
pendency f-scores (defined in Section 2.1) before 
using the converted treebank for parser training

translation.
because these trees are &quot;misleading&quot; training in-
stances. The number of removed trees will be de-
termined by cross validation on development set.
Score Interpolation Unlabeled dependency 
f-scores used in Section 2.1 measure the quality of 
converted trees from the perspective of the source 
grammar only. In extreme cases, the top best 
parses in the N-best list are good conversion can-
didates but we might select a parse ranked quite 
low in the N-best list since there might be con-
flicts of syntactic structure definition between the 
source grammar and the target grammar.
Figure 1 shows an example for illustration of 
a conflict between the grammar of CDT and 
that of CTB. According to Chinese head percola-
tion tables used in the PS to DS conversion tool 
&quot;Penn2Malt&quot; 3 and Charniak’s parser4, the head 
of VP-2 is the word &quot; 4E &quot; (a preposition, with 
&quot;BA&quot; as its POS tag in CTB), and the head of 
IP-OBJ is R hJ &quot; . Therefore the word &quot; R 
hJ&quot; depends on the word &quot;4E&quot; . But according 
to the annotation scheme in CDT (Liu et al., 2006), 
the word &quot;4E&quot; is a dependent of the word &quot;R 
hJ &quot; . The conflicts between the two grammars 
may lead to the problem that the selected parses 
based on the information of the source grammar 
might not be preferred from the perspective of the

target grammar.
Therefore we modified the selection metric in 
Section 2.1 by interpolating two scores, the prob-
ability of a conversion candidate from the parser 
and its unlabeled dependency f-score, shown as 
follows:
Score(xi,t) = AxProb(xi,t)+(1—A)xScore(xi,t). (1)
The intuition behind this equation is that converted 
trees should be preferred from the perspective of 
both the source grammar and the target grammar. 
Here 0 &lt; A &lt; 1. Prob(xi,t) is a probability pro-
duced by the parser for xi,t (0 &lt; Prob(xi,t) &lt; 1). 
The value of A will be tuned by cross validation on 
development set.
After grammar formalism conversion, the prob-
lem now we face has been limited to how to build 
parsing models on multiple homogeneous tree- 
bank. A possible solution is to simply concate-
nate the two treebanks as training data. However 
this method may lead to a problem that if the size 
of CPS is significantly less than that of converted 
CDS, converted CDS may weaken the effect CPS 
might have. One possible solution is to reduce the 
weight of examples from converted CDS in parser 
training. Corpus weighting is exactly such an ap-
proach, with the weight tuned on development set, 
that will be used for parsing on homogeneous tree- 
banks in this paper.
3 Experiments of Grammar Formalism 
Conversion
3.1 Evaluation on WSJ section 22
Xia et al. (2008) used WSJ section 19 from the 
Penn Treebank to extract DS to PS conversion 
rules and then produced dependency trees from 
WSJ section 22 for evaluation of their DS to PS 
conversion algorithm. They showed that their 
conversion algorithm outperformed existing meth-
ods on the WSJ data. For comparison with their 
work, we conducted experiments in the same set-
ting as theirs: using WSJ section 19 (1844 sen-
tences) as CPS, producing dependency trees from 
WSJ section 22 (1700 sentences) as CDS5, and 
using labeled bracketing f-scores from the tool 
&quot;EVALB&quot; on WSJ section 22 for performance 
evaluation.
5We used the tool &quot;Penn2Malt&quot; to produce dependency
structures from the Penn Treebank, which was also used for 
PS to DS conversion in our conversion algorithm.

2-18 and 20-22.
We employed Charniak’s maximum entropy in-
spired parser (Charniak, 2000) to generate N-best 
(N=200) parses. Xia et al. (2008) used POS 
tag information, dependency structures and depen-
dency tags in test set for conversion. Similarly, we 
used POS tag information in the test set to restrict 
search space of the parser for generation of better 
N-best parses.
We evaluated two variants of our DS to PS con-
version algorithm:
Q-0-method: We set the value of Q as 0 for a 
baseline method.
Q-10-method: We set the value of Q as 10 to 
see whether it is helpful for conversion to retrain 
the parser on converted trees.
Table 2 shows the results of our conversion al-
gorithm on WSJ section 22. In the experiment 
of Q-10-method, DevScore reached the highest 
value of 88.0% when q was 1. Then we used 
Cps,1 as the conversion result. Finally Q-10- 
method achieved an f-score of 93.8% on WSJ sec-
tion 22, an absolute 4.4% improvement (42% er-
ror reduction) over the best result of Xia et al. 
(2008). Moreover, Q-10-method outperformed Q-
0-method on the same test set. These results indi-
cate that it is feasible to use a parser for DS to PS 
conversion and the conversion benefits from the 
use of converted trees for parser retraining.
3.2 Evaluation on WSJ section 2-18 and 
20-22
In this experiment we evaluated our conversion al-
gorithm on a larger test set, WSJ section 2-18 and 
20-22 (totally 39688 sentences). Here we also 
used WSJ section 19 as CPS. Other settings for

this experiment are as same as that in Section 3. 1, 
except that here we used a larger test set.
Table 3 provides the f-scores of our method with 
Q equal to 0 or 10 on WSJ section 2-18 and 
20-22.
With Q-10-method, DevScore reached the high-
est value of 91.6% when q was 1. Finally Q-
10-method achieved an f-score of 93.6% on WSJ 
section 2-18 and 20-22, better than that of Q-0- 
method and comparable with that of Q-10-method 
in Section 3.1. It confirms our previous finding 
that the conversion benefits from the use of con-
verted trees for parser retraining.
4 Experiments of Parsing
We investigated our two-step solution on two ex-
isting treebanks, CDT and CTB, and we used CDT 
as the source treebank and CTB as the target tree- 
bank.
CDT consists of 60k Chinese sentences, anno-
tated with POS tag information and dependency 
structure information (including 28 POS tags, and 
24 dependency tags) (Liu et al., 2006). We did not 
use POS tag information as inputs to the parser in 
our conversion method due to the difficulty of con-
version from CDT POS tags to CTB POS tags.
We used a standard split of CTB for perfor-
mance evaluation, articles 1-270 and 400-1151 as 
training set, articles 301-325 as development set, 
and articles 271-300 as test set.
We used Charniak’s maximum entropy inspired 
parser and their reranker (Charniak and Johnson, 
2005) for target grammar parsing, called a gener-
ative parser (GP) and a reranking parser (RP) re-
spectively. We reported ParseVal measures from 
the EVALB tool.

combination of CTB training set and CDTPS.
4.1 Results of a Baseline Method to Use CDT
We used our conversion algorithm6 to convert the 
grammar formalism of CDT to that of CTB. Let 
CDTPS denote the converted CDT by our method. 
The average unlabeled dependency f-score of trees 
in CDTPS was 74.4%, and their average index in 
200-best list was 48.
We tried the corpus weighting method when 
combining CDTPS with CTB training set (abbre-
viated as CTB for simplicity) as training data, by 
gradually increasing the weight (including 1, 2, 5, 
10, 20, 50) of CTB to optimize parsing perfor-
mance on the development set. Table 4 presents 
the results of the generative parser with various 
weights of CTB on the development set. Consid-
ering the performance on the development set, we 
decided to give CTB a relative weight of 10.
Finally we evaluated two parsing models, the 
generative parser and the reranking parser, on the 
test set, with results shown in Table 5. When 
trained on CTB only, the generative parser and the 
reranking parser achieved f-scores of 81.0% and 
83.3%. The use of CDTPS as additional training 
data increased f-scores of the two models to 81.5% 
and 83.8%.
4.2 Results of Two Strategies for a Better Use 
of CDT
4.2.1 Instance Pruning
We used unlabeled dependency f-score of each 
converted tree as the criterion to rank trees in 
CDTPS and then kept only the top M trees 
with high f-scores as training data for pars-
ing, resulting in a corpus CDTPMS. M var-
ied from 100% xICDTPSI to 10% xICDTPSI 
with 10%xICDTPSI as the interval. ICDTPSI
6The setting for our conversion algorithm in this experi-
ment was as same as that in Section 3.1. In addition, we used 
CTB training set as CPS,tr�i�, and CTB development set as 
CPS,dev.

is the number of trees in CDTPS. Then
we tuned the value of M by optimizing the 
parser’s performance on the development set with 
10 x CTB+CDTPMS as training data. Finally the op-
timal value of M was 100%x I CDT I. It indicates 
that even removing very few converted trees hurts 
the parsing performance. A possible reason is that 
most of non-perfect parses can provide useful syn-
tactic structure information for building parsing 
models.
4.2.2 Score Interpolation
We used �Score(xj,t)7 to replace Score(xj,t) in 
our conversion algorithm and then ran the updated 
algorithm on CDT. Let CDTP S denote the con-
verted CDT by this updated conversion algorithm. 
The values of A (varying from 0.0 to 1.0 with 0.1 
as the interval) and the CTB weight (including 1, 
2, 5, 10, 20, 50) were simultaneously tuned on the 
development set8. Finally we decided that the op-
timal value of A was 0.4 and the optimal weight of 
CTB was 1, which brought the best performance 
on the development set (an f-score of 86.1%). In 
comparison with the results in Section 4.1, the 
average index of converted trees in 200-best list 
increased to 2, and their average unlabeled depen-
dency f-score dropped to 65.4%. It indicates that 
structures of converted trees become more consis-
tent with the target grammar, as indicated by the 
increase of average index of converted trees, fur-
ther away from the source grammar.
Table 6 provides f-scores of the generative 
parser and the reranker on the test set, when 
trained on CTB and CDTP S. We see that the 
performance of the reranking parser increased to
7Before calculating	�Score(xi,t),	we normal-
ized the values of Prob(xi,t) for each N-best list
by	(1)	Prob(xi,t)=Prob(xi,t)-Min(Prob(xi,*)),
(2)Prob(xi,t)=Prob(xi,t)/Max(Prob(xi,*)),	resulting
in that their maximum value was 1 and their minimum value 
was 0.
8Due to space constraint, we do not show f-scores of the 
parser with different values of A and the CTB weight.

ing parser with CTB and CDTPS as training data 
(shown in Table 5). It indicates that the use of 
probability information from the parser for tree 
conversion helps target grammar parsing.
4.3 Using Unlabeled Data for Parsing
Recent studies on parsing indicate that the use of 
unlabeled data by self-training can help parsing 
on the WSJ data, even when labeled data is rel-
atively large (McClosky et al., 2006a; Reichart 
and Rappoport, 2007). It motivates us to em-
ploy self-training technique for Chinese parsing. 
We used the POS tagged People Daily corpus9 
(Jan. 1998—Jun. 1998, and Jan. 2000—Dec. 
2000) (PDC) as unlabeled data for parsing. First 
we removed the sentences with less than 3 words 
or more than 40 words from PDC to ease pars-
ing, resulting in 820k sentences. Then we ran the 
reranking parser in Section 4.2.2 on PDC and used 
the parses on PDC as additional training data for 
the generative parser. Here we tried the corpus 
weighting technique for an optimal combination 
of CTB, CDTP s and parsed PDC, and chose the 
relative weight of both CTB and CDTP s as 10 
by cross validation on the development set. Fi-
nally we retrained the generative parser on CTB, 
CDTP s and parsed PDC. Furthermore, we used 
this self-trained generative parser as a base parser 
to retrain the reranker on CTB and CDTP s.
Table 7 shows the performance of self-trained 
generative parser and updated reranker on the test 
set, with CTB and CDTP s as labeled data. We see 
that the use of unlabeled data by self-training fur-
ther increased the reranking parser’s performance 
from 84.2% to 85.2%. Our results on Chinese data 
confirm previous findings on English data shown 
in (McClosky et al., 2006a; Reichart and Rap-
poport, 2007).

4.4 Comparison with Previous Studies for 
Chinese Parsing
Table 8 and 9 present the results of previous stud-
ies on CTB. All the works in Table 8 used CTB 
articles 1-270 as labeled data. In Table 9, Petrov 
and Klein (2007) trained their model on CTB ar-
ticles 1-270 and 400-1151, and Burkett and Klein 
(2008) used the same CTB articles and parse trees 
of their English translation (from the English Chi-
nese Translation Treebank) as training data. Com-
paring our result in Table 6 with that of Petrov 
and Klein (2007), we see that CDTP s helps pars-
ing on CTB, which brought 0.9% f-score improve-
ment. Moreover, the use of unlabeled data further 
boosted the parsing performance to 85.2%, an ab-
solute 1.0% improvement over the previous best 
result presented in Burkett and Klein (2008).
5 Related Work
Recently there have been some studies address-
ing how to use treebanks with same grammar for-
malism for domain adaptation of parsers. Roark 
and Bachiani (2003) presented count merging and 
model interpolation techniques for domain adap-
tation of parsers. They showed that their sys-
tem with count merging achieved a higher perfor-
mance when in-domain data was weighted more 
heavily than out-of-domain data. McClosky et al. 
(2006b) used self-training and corpus weighting to 
adapt their parser trained on WSJ corpus to Brown 
corpus. Their results indicated that both unla-
beled in-domain data and labeled out-of-domain 
data can help domain adaptation. In comparison 
with these works, we conduct our study in a dif-
ferent setting where we work with multiple het-
erogeneous treebanks.
Grammar formalism conversion makes it possi-
ble to reuse existing source treebanks for the study 
of target grammar parsing. Wang et al. (1994) 
employed a parser to help conversion of a tree- 
bank from a simple phrase structure to a more in-
formative phrase structure and then used this con-
verted treebank to train their parser. Collins et al. 
(1999) performed statistical constituency parsing 
of Czech on a treebank that was converted from 
the Prague Dependency Treebank under the guid-
ance of conversion rules and heuristic rules, e.g., 
one level of projection for any category, minimal 
projection for any dependents, and fixed position 
of attachment. Xia and Palmer (2001) adopted bet-
ter heuristic rules to build converted trees, which

reflected the structural preference in their target 
grammar. For acquisition of better conversion 
rules, Xia et al. (2008) proposed to automati-
cally extract conversion rules from a target tree- 
bank. Moreover, they presented two strategies to 
solve the problem that there might be multiple 
conversion rules matching the same input depen-
dency tree pattern: (1) choosing the most frequent 
rules, (2) preferring rules that add fewer number 
of nodes and attach the subtree lower.
In comparison with the works of Wang et al. 
(1994) and Collins et al. (1999), we went fur-
ther by combining the converted treebank with the 
existing target treebank for parsing. In compar-
ison with previous conversion methods (Collins 
et al., 1999; Covington, 1994; Xia and Palmer, 
2001; Xia et al., 2008) in which for each head- 
dependent pair, only one locally optimal conver-
sion was kept during tree-building process, we 
employed a parser to generate globally optimal 
syntactic structures, eliminating heuristic rules for 
conversion. In addition, we used converted trees to 
retrain the parser for better conversion candidates, 
while Wang et al. (1994) did not exploit the use of 
converted trees for parser retraining.
6 Conclusion
We have proposed a two-step solution to deal with 
the issue of using heterogeneous treebanks for 
parsing. First we present a parser based method 
to convert grammar formalisms of the treebanks to 
the same one, without applying predefined heuris-
tic rules, thus turning the original problem into the 
problem of parsing on homogeneous treebanks.
Then we present two strategies, instance pruning 
and score interpolation, to refine conversion re-
sults. Finally we adopt the corpus weighting tech-
nique to combine the converted source treebank 
with the existing target treebank for parser train-
ing.
The study on the WSJ data shows the benefits of 
our parser based approach for grammar formalism 
conversion. Moreover, experimental results on the 
Penn Chinese Treebank indicate that a converted 
dependency treebank helps constituency parsing, 
and it is better to exploit probability information 
produced by the parser through score interpolation 
than to prune low quality trees for the use of the 
converted treebank.
Future work includes further investigation of 
our conversion method for other pairs of grammar 
formalisms, e.g., from the grammar formalism of 
the Penn Treebank to more deep linguistic formal-
ism like CCG, HPSG, or LFG.
