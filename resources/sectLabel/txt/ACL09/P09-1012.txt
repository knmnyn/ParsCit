Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian 
model for fully unsupervised word seg-
mentation and an efficient blocked Gibbs 
sampler combined with dynamic program-
ming for inference. Our model is a nested 
hierarchical Pitman-Yor language model, 
where Pitman-Yor spelling model is em-
bedded in the word model. We confirmed 
that it significantly outperforms previous 
reported results in both phonetic tran-
scripts and standard datasets for Chinese 
and Japanese word segmentation. Our 
model is also considered as a way to con-
struct an accurate word n-gram language 
model directly from characters of arbitrary 
language, without any “word” indications.
1 Introduction
“Word” is no trivial concept in many languages. 
Asian languages such as Chinese and Japanese 
have no explicit word boundaries, thus word seg-
mentation is a crucial first step when processing 
them. Even in western languages, valid “words” 
are often not identical to space-separated tokens. 
For example, proper nouns such as “United King-
dom” or idiomatic phrases such as “with respect 
to” actually function as a single word, and we of-
ten condense them into the virtual words “UK” 
and “w.r.t.”.
In order to extract “words” from text streams, 
unsupervised word segmentation is an important 
research area because the criteria for creating su-
pervised training data could be arbitrary, and will 
be suboptimal for applications that rely on seg-
mentations. It is particularly difficult to create 
“correct” training data for speech transcripts, col-
loquial texts, and classics where segmentations are 
often ambiguous, let alone is impossible for un-
known languages whose properties computational 
linguists might seek to uncover.
From a scientific point of view, it is also inter-
esting because it can shed light on how children 
learn “words” without the explicitly given bound-
aries for every word, which is assumed by super-
vised learning approaches.
Lately, model-based methods have been intro-
duced for unsupervised segmentation, in particu-
lar those based on Dirichlet processes on words 
(Goldwater et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2008). This 
maximizes the probability of word segmentation 
w given a string s :
w� = argmax p(w|s) • (1)
W
This approach often implicitly includes heuristic 
criteria proposed so far&apos;, while having a clear sta-
tistical semantics to find the most probable word 
segmentation that will maximize the probability of 
the data, here the strings.
However, they are still naive with respect to 
word spellings, and the inference is very slow ow-
ing to inefficient Gibbs sampling. Crucially, since 
they rely on sampling a word boundary between 
two neighboring words, they can leverage only up 
to bigram word dependencies.
In this paper, we extend this work to pro-
pose a more efficient and accurate unsupervised 
word segmentation that will optimize the per-
formance of the word n-gram Pitman-Yor (i.e. 
Bayesian Kneser-Ney) language model, with an 
accurate character oc-gram Pitman-Yor spelling 
model embedded in word models. Further-
more, it can be viewed as a method for building 
a high-performance n-gram language model di-
rectly from character strings of arbitrary language. 
It is carefully smoothed and has no “unknown 
words” problem, resulting from its model struc-
ture.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
&apos;For instance, TANGO algorithm (Ando and Lee, 2003)
essentially finds segments such that character n-gram proba-
bilities are maximized blockwise, averaged over n.

we briefly describe a language model based on the 
Pitman-Yor process (Teh, 2006b), which is a gen-
eralization of the Dirichlet process used in previ-
ous research. By embedding a character n-gram 
in word n-gram from a Bayesian perspective, Sec-
tion 3 introduces a novel language model for word 
segmentation, which we call the Nested Pitman-
Yor language model. Section 4 describes an ef-
ficient blocked Gibbs sampler that leverages dy-
namic programming for inference. In Section 5 we 
describe experiments on the standard datasets in 
Chinese and Japanese in addition to English pho-
netic transcripts, and semi-supervised experiments 
are also explored. Section 6 is a discussion and 
Section 7 concludes the paper.
2 Pitman-Yor process and n-gram 
models
To compute a probability p(wIs) in (1), we adopt 
a Bayesian language model lately proposed by 
(Teh, 2006b; Goldwater et al., 2005) based on 
the Pitman-Yor process, a generalization of the 
Dirichlet process. As we shall see, this is a 
Bayesian theory of the best-performing Kneser-
Ney smoothing of n-grams (Kneser and Ney, 
1995), allowing an integrated modeling from a 
Bayesian perspective as persued in this paper.
The Pitman-Yor (PY) process is a stochastic 
process that generates discrete probability distri-
bution G that is similar to another distribution G0, 
called a base measure. It is written as
G — PY(G0, d, 0) , (2)
where d is a discount factor and 0 controls how 
similar G is to G0 on average.
Suppose we have a unigram word distribution 
G1 = { p(•) } where • ranges over each word in the 
lexicon. The bigram distribution G2 = { p(• Iv) } 
given a word v is different from G1, but will be 
similar to G1 especially for high frequency words. 
Therefore, we can generate G2 from a PY pro-
cess of base measure G1, as G2 — PY(G1, d, 0). 
Similarly, trigram distribution G3 = { p(• Iv&apos;v) }
given an additional word v&apos; is generated as G3 —
PY(G2, d, 0), and G1, G2, G3 will form a tree 
structure shown in Figure 1(a).
In practice, we cannot observe G directly be-
cause it will be infinite dimensional distribution 
over the possible words, as we shall see in this 
paper. However, when we integrate out G it is 
known that Figure 1(a) can be represented by an 
equivalent hierarchical Chinese Restaurant Pro-
cess (CRP) (Aldous, 1985) as in Figure 1(b).
In this representation, each n-gram context h 
(including the null context c for unigrams) is 
a Chinese restaurant whose customers are the 
n-gram counts c(wIh) seated over the tables 
1 • • • thw. The seatings has been incrementally 
constructed by choosing the table k for each count 
in c(wIh) with probability proportional to
�chwk −
0+dt
d (k = 1,•• • , thw)
h. (k = new) ,	(3)
where chwk is the number of customers seated at 
table k thus far and th. = Ew thw is the total num-
ber of tables in h. When k = new is selected, 
thw is incremented, and this means that the count 
was actually generated from the shorter context h&apos;. 
Therefore, in that case a proxy customer is sent to 
the parent restaurant and this process will recurse. 
For example, if we have a sentence “she will 
sing” in the training data for trigrams, we add each 
word “she” “will” “sing” “$” as a customer to its 
two preceding words context node, as described 
in Figure 1(b). Here, “$” is a special token rep-
resenting a sentence boundary in language model-
101
ing (Brown et al., 1992).
As a result, the n-gram probability of this hier-
archical Pitman-Yor language model (HPYLM) is 
recursively computed as
p(wI h) = c(wB+c(h)thw + 0+c(h) p(wI h&apos;),
(4) 
where p(wIh&apos;) is the same probability using a 
(n−1)-gram context h&apos;. When we set thw - 1, (4) 
recovers a Kneser-Ney smoothing: thus a HPYLM 
is a Bayesian Kneser-Ney language model as well 
as an extension of the hierarchical Dirichlet Pro-
cess (HDP) used in Goldwater et al. (2006). 0, d 
are hyperparameters that can be learned as Gamma 
and Beta posteriors, respectively, given the data. 
For details, see Teh (2006a).
The inference of this model interleaves adding 
and removing a customer to optimize thw, d, and 
0 using MCMC. However, in our case “words” 
are not known a priori: the next section describes 
how to accomplish this by constructing a nested 
HPYLM of words and characters, with the associ-
ated inference algorithm.
3 Nested Pitman-Yor Language Model
Thus far we have assumed that the unigram G1 
is already given, but of course it should also be 
generated as G1 — PY(G0, d, 0).
Here, a problem occurs: What should we use for 
G0, namely the prior probabilities over words2. 
If a lexicon is finite, we can use a uniform prior 
G0 (w) = 1/ I V I for every word w in lexicon V. 
However, with word segmentation every substring 
could be a word, thus the lexicon is not limited but 
will be countably infinite.
Building an accurate G0 is crucial for word 
segmentation, since it determines how the possi-
ble words will look like. Previous work using a 
Dirichlet process used a relatively simple prior for 
G0, namely an uniform distribution over charac-
ters (Goldwater et al., 2006), or a prior solely de-
pendent on word length with a Poisson distribution 
whose parameter is fixed by hand (Xu et al., 2008).
In contrast, in this paper we use a simple but 
more elaborate model, that is, a character n-gram 
language model that also employs HPYLM. This 
is important because in English, for example, 
words are likely to end in ‘–tion’ and begin with
2Note that this is different from unigrams, which are pos-
terior distribution given data.
Figure 2: Chinese restaurant representation of our 
Nested Pitman-Yor Language Model (NPYLM).
‘re–’, but almost never end in ‘–tio’ nor begin with 
‘sre–’ 3.
Therefore, we use
G0 (w) = p(c1 ••• ck)	(5)
p( ci I c1 ••• ci�1)	(6)
where string c1 • • • ck is a spelling of w, and
p(ciIc1 • • • ci�1) is given by the character HPYLM 
according to (4).
This language model, which we call Nested 
Pitman-Yor Language Model (NPYLM) hereafter, 
is the hierarchical language model shown in Fig-
ure 2, where the character HPYLM is embedded 
as a base measure of the word HPYLM.4 As the 
final base measure for the character HPYLM, we 
used a uniform prior over the possible characters 
of a given language. To avoid dependency on n- 
gram order n, we actually used the oc-gram lan-
guage model (Mochihashi and Sumita, 2007), a 
variable order HPYLM, for characters. However, 
for generality we hereafter state that we used the 
HPYLM. The theory remains the same for oc-
grams, except sampling or marginalizing over n 
as needed.
Furthermore, we corrected (5) so that word 
length will have a Poisson distribution whose pa-
rameter can now be estimated for a given language 
and word type. We describe this in detail in Sec-
tion 4.3.
Chinese Restaurant Representation
In our NPYLM, the word model and the charac-
ter model are not separate but connected through 
a nested CRP. When a word w is generated from 
its parent at the unigram node, it means that w
3Imagine we try to segment an English character string 
“itisrecognizedasthe• • • .”
4Strictly speaking, this is not “nested” in the sense of a 
Nested Dirichlet process (Rodriguez et al., 2008) and could 
be called “hierarchical HPYLM”, which denotes another 
model for domain adaptation (Wood and Teh, 2008).

is drawn from the base measure, namely a char-
acter HPYLM. Then we divide w into characters 
c1•••ck to yield a “sentence” of characters and 
feed this into the character HPYLM as data.
Conversely, when a table becomes empty, this 
means that the data associated with the table are 
no longer valid. Therefore we remove the corre-
sponding customers from the character HPYLM 
using the inverse procedure of adding a customer 
in Section 2.
All these processes will be invoked when a 
string is segmented into “words” and customers 
are added to the leaves of the word HPYLM. To 
segment a string into “words”, we used efficient 
dynamic programming combined with MCMC, as 
described in the next section.
4 Inference
To find the hidden word segmentation w of a string 
s = c1 • • • cN, which is equivalent to the vector of 
binary hidden variables z = z1 • • • zN, the sim-
plest approach is to build a Gibbs sampler that ran-
domly selects a character ci and draw a binary de-
cision zi as to whether there is a word boundary, 
and then update the language model according to 
the new segmentation (Goldwater et al., 2006; Xu 
et al., 2008). When we iterate this procedure suf-
ficiently long, it becomes a sample from the true 
distribution (1) (Gilks et al., 1996).
However, this sampler is too inefficient since 
time series data such as word segmentation have a 
very high correlation between neighboring words. 
As a result, the sampler is extremely slow to con-
verge. In fact, (Goldwater et al., 2006) reports that 
the sampler would not mix without annealing, and 
the experiments needed 20,000 times of sampling 
for every character in the training data.
Furthermore, it has an inherent limitation that 
it cannot deal with larger than bigrams, because it 
uses only local statistics between directly contigu-
ous words for word segmentation.
4.1 Blocked Gibbs sampler
Instead, we propose a sentence-wise Gibbs sam-
pler of word segmentation using efficient dynamic 
programming, as shown in Figure 3.
In this algorithm, first we randomly select a 
string, and then remove the “sentence” data of its 
word segmentation from the NPYLM. Sampling 
a new segmentation, we update the NPYLM by 
adding a new “sentence” according to the new seg-

mentation. When we repeat this process, it is ex-
pected to mix rapidly because it implicitly consid-
ers all possible segmentations of the given string 
at the same time.
This is called a blocked Gibbs sampler that sam-
ples z block-wise for each sentence. It has an ad-
ditional advantage in that we can accommodate 
higher-order relationships than bigrams, particu-
larly trigrams, for word segmentation. 5
4.2 Forward-Backward inference
Then, how can we sample a segmentation w for 
each string s? In accordance with the Forward fil-
tering Backward sampling of HMM (Scott, 2002), 
this is achieved by essentially the same algorithm 
employed to sample a PCFG parse tree within 
MCMC (Johnson et al., 2007) and grammar-based 
segmentation (Johnson and Goldwater, 2009).
Forward Filtering. For this purpose, we main-
tain a forward variable a[t] [k] in the bigram case. 
a[t][k] is the probability of a string c1 • • • ct with 
the final k characters being a word (see Figure 4). 
Segmentations before the final k characters are 
marginalized using the following recursive rela-
tionship:
p(ctt—k+11 ct—k
t—k—j+1) •a[t—k] [j] (7)
where a[0][0] =1 and we wrote cr,, • • • cm as cmn .6 
The rationale for (7) is as follows. Since main-
taining binary variables z1, • • • , zN is equivalent 
to maintaining a distance to the nearest backward
5In principle fourgrams or beyond are also possible, but 
will be too complex while the gain will be small. For this 
purpose, Particle MCMC (Doucet et al., 2009) is promising 
but less efficient in a preliminary experiment.
6As Murphy (2002) noted, in semi-HMM we cannot use a 
standard trick to avoid underflow by normalizing a [t] [k] into
p(k�t), since the model is asynchronous. Instead we always
compute (7) using logsumexp () .

where we used conditional independency of qt
given qt—k and uniform prior over qt in (11) above.
Backward Sampling. Once the probability ta-
ble �[t] [k] is obtained, we can sample a word seg-
mentation backwards. Since � [N] [k] is a marginal 
probability of string c�1 with the last k charac-
ters being a word, and there is always a sentence 
boundary token $ at the end of the string, with
probability proportional to p($ I cN—k) • � [N] [k] we
can sample k to choose the boundary of the final 
word. The second final word is similarly sampled 
using the probability of preceding the last word 
just sampled: we continue this process until we 
arrive at the beginning of the string (Figure 5).
Trigram case. For simplicity, we showed the 
algorithm for bigrams above. For trigrams, we
maintain a forward variable �[t] [k] [j], which rep-
resents a marginal probability of string c1 • • • ct 
with both the final k characters and further j 
characters preceding it being words. Forward- 
Backward algorithm becomes complicated thus 
omitted, but can be derived following the extended 
algorithm for second order HMM (He, 1988).
Complexity This algorithm has a complexity of 
O (NL2) for bigrams and O (NL3) for trigrams 
for each sentence, where N is the length of the 
sentence and L is the maximum allowed length of 
a word (&lt; N).
4.3 Poisson correction
Po(kIA) = e—A �1 .	(13)
k
Since the appearance of c1 • • • ck is equivalent 
to that of length k and the content, by making the 
character n-gram model explicit as O we can set
p(c1 ••• ck) = p(c1 ••• ck, k)	(14)
p(c1 ••• ck, kI�)
p(kI �)	Po(kIA) (15)
=
where p(c1 • • • ck, kI0) is an n-gram probabil-
ity given by (6), and p(kI0) is a probability 
that a word of length k will be generated from 
O. While previous work used p(kI0) = (1 — 
p($))k—1p($), this is only true for unigrams. In-
stead, we employed a Monte Carlo method that 
generates words randomly from O to obtain the 
empirical estimates of p(kI0).
Estimating A. Of course, we do not leave A as a 
constant. Instead, we put a Gamma distribution
a
p(A) =Ga(a, b) =  a F(a) A —1 e—ba	(16)
to estimate A from the data for given language 
and word type.7 Here, F(x) is a Gamma function 
and a, b are the hyperparameters chosen to give a 
nearly uniform prior distribution.$
7We used different A for different word types, such as dig-
its, alphabets, hiragana, CJK characters, and their mixtures. 
W is a set of words of each such type, and (13) becomes a 
mixture of Poisson distributions in this case.
8In the following experiments, we set a = 0.2, b = 0.1.
As Nagata (1996) noted, when only (5) is used in-
adequately low probabilities are assigned to long 
words, because it has a largely exponential dis-
tribution over length. To correct this, we assume 
that word length k has a Poisson distribution with 
a mean A:
104
Denoting W as a set of “words” obtained from 
word segmentation, the posterior distribution of A 
used for (13) is
p(AIW) a p(W I A)p(A)
1:
= Ga (a+ 1: t(w) I w I , b+
wEW wEW
where t(w) is the number of times word w is gen-
erated from the character HPYLM, i.e. the number 
of tables tew for w in word unigrams. We sampled 
A from this posterior for each Gibbs iteration.
5 Experiments
To validate our model, we conducted experiments 
on standard datasets for Chinese and Japanese 
word segmentation that are publicly available, as 
well as the same dataset used in (Goldwater et al., 
2006). Note that NPYLM maximizes the probabil-
ity of strings, equivalently, minimizes the perplex-
ity per character. Therefore, the recovery of the 
“ground truth” that is not available for inference is 
a byproduct in unsupervised learning.
Since our implementation is based on Unicode 
and learns all hyperparameters from the data, we 
also confirmed that NPYLM segments the Arabic 
Gigawords equally well.
5.1 English phonetic transcripts
In order to directly compare with the previously 
reported result, we first used the same dataset 
as Goldwater et al. (2006). This dataset con-
sists of 9,790 English phonetic transcripts from 
CHILDES data (MacWhinney and Snow, 1985).
Since our algorithm converges rather fast, we 
ran the Gibbs sampler of trigram NPYLM for 200 
iterations to obtain the results in Table 1. Among 
the token precision (P), recall (R), and F-measure 
(F), the recall is especially higher to outperform 
the previous result based on HDP in F-measure. 
Meanwhile, the same measures over the obtained 
lexicon (LP, LR, LF) are not always improved. 
Moreover, the average length of words inferred 
was surprisingly similar to ground truth: 2.88, 
while the ground truth is 2.87.
Table 2 shows the empirical computational time 
needed to obtain these results. Although the con-
vergence in MCMC is not uniquely identified, im-
provement in efficiency is also outstanding.
5.2 Chinese and Japanese word segmentation
To show applicability beyond small phonetic tran-
scripts, we used standard datasets for Chinese and

segmentations removed in advance.
Chinese For Chinese, we used a publicly avail-
able SIGHAN Bakeoff 2005 dataset (Emerson, 
2005). To compare with the latest unsupervised 
results (using a closed dataset of Bakeoff 2006), 
we chose the common sets prepared by Microsoft 
Research Asia (MSR) for simplified Chinese, and 
by City University of Hong Kong (CITYU) for 
traditional Chinese. We used a random subset of 
50,000 sentences from each dataset for training, 
and the evaluation was conducted on the enclosed 
test data. 9
Japanese For Japanese, we used the Kyoto Cor-
pus (Kyoto) (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998): we 
used random subset of 1,000 sentences for evalua-
tion and the remaining 37,400 sentences for train-
ing. In all cases we removed all whitespaces to 
yield raw character strings for inference, and set 
L = 4 for Chinese and L = 8 for Japanese to run 
the Gibbs sampler for 400 iterations.
The results (in token F-measures) are shown in 
Table 3. Our NPYLM significantly ourperforms 
the best results using a heuristic approach reported 
in Zhao and Kit (2008). While Japanese accura-
cies appear lower, subjective qualities are much 
higher. This is mostly because NPYLM segments 
inflectional suffixes and combines frequent proper 
names, which are inconsistent with the “correct”
9Notice that analyzing a test data is not easy for character- 
wise Gibbs sampler of previous work. Meanwhile, NPYLM 
easily finds the best segmentation using the Viterbi algorithm 
once the model is learned.

segmentations. Bigram and trigram performances 
are similar for Chinese, but trigram performs bet-
ter for Japanese. In fact, although the difference 
in perplexity per character is not so large, the per-
plexity per word is radically reduced: 439.8 (bi-
gram) to 190.1 (trigram). This is because trigram 
models can leverage complex dependencies over 
words to yield shorter words, resulting in better 
predictions and increased tokens.
Furthermore, NPYLM is easily amenable to 
semi-supervised or even supervised learning. In 
that case, we have only to replace the word seg-
mentation w(s) in Figure 3 to the supervised one, 
for all or part of the training data. Table 4

or even 97% (Japanese) in supervised case. The 
result also shows that the supervised segmenta-
tions are suboptimal with respect to the perplex-
ity per character, and even worse than unsuper-
vised results. In semi-supervised case, using only 
10K reference segmentations gives a performance 
of around 90% accuracy and the lowest perplexity, 
thanks to a combination with unsupervised data in 
a principled fashion.
5.3 Classics and English text
Our model is particularly effective for spoken tran-
scripts, colloquial texts, classics, or unknown lan-
guages where supervised segmentation data is dif-
ficult or even impossible to create. For example, 
we are pleased to say that we can now analyze (and 
build a language model on) “The Tale of Genji”, 
the core of Japanese classics written 1,000 years 
ago (Figure 6). The inferred segmentations are
Figure 6: Unsupervised segmentation result for 
“The Tale of Genji”. (16,443 sentences, 899,668 
characters in total)
mostly correct, with some inflectional suffixes be-
ing recognized as words, which is also the case 
with English.
Finally, we note that our model is also effective 
for western languages: Figure 7 shows a training 
text of “Alice in Wonderland ” with all whitespaces 
removed, and the segmentation result.
While the data is extremely small (only 1,431 
lines, 115,961 characters), our trigram NPYLM 
can infer the words surprisingly well. This is be-
cause our model contains both word and character 
models that are combined and carefully smoothed, 
from a Bayesian perspective.
6 Discussion
In retrospect, our NPYLM is essentially a hier-
archical Markov model where the units (=words) 
evolve as the Markov process, and each unit 
has subunits (=characters) that also evolve as the 
Markov process. Therefore, for such languages 
as English that have already space-separated to-
kens, we can also begin with tokens besides the 
character-based approach in Section 5.3. In this 
case, each token is a “character” whose code is the 
integer token type, and a sentence is a sequence of 
“characters.” Figure 8 shows a part of the result 
computed over 100K sentences from Penn Tree- 
bank. We can see that some frequent phrases are 
identified as “words”, using a fully unsupervised 
approach. Notice that this is only attainable with 
NPYLM where each phrase is described as a n- 
gram model on its own, here a word oc-gram lan-
guage model.
While we developed an efficient forward- 
backward algorithm for unsupervised segmenta-
tion, it is reminiscent of CRF in the discrimina-
tive approach. Therefore, it is also interesting 
to combine them in a discriminative way as per- 
sued in POS tagging using CRF+HMM (Suzuki et 
al., 2007), let alone a simple semi-supervised ap-
proach in Section 5.2. This paper provides a foun-
dation of such possibilities.

7 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a much more efficient 
and accurate model for fully unsupervised word 
segmentation. With a combination of dynamic 
programming and an accurate spelling model from 
a Bayesian perspective, our model significantly 
outperforms the previous reported results, and the 
inference is very efficient.
This model is also considered as a way to build 
a Bayesian Kneser-Ney smoothed word n-gram 
language model directly from characters with no 
“word” indications. In fact, it achieves lower per-
plexity per character than that based on supervised 
segmentations. We believe this will be particu-
larly beneficial to build a language model on such 
texts as speech transcripts, colloquial texts or un-
known languages, where word boundaries are hard 
or even impossible to identify a priori.
