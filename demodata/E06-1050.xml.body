Abstract
All questions are implicitly associated 
with an expected answer type. Unlike 
previous approaches that require a prede-
fined set of question types, we present 
a method for dynamically constructing 
a probability-based answer type model 
for each different question. Our model 
evaluates the appropriateness of a poten-
tial answer by the probability that it fits 
into the question contexts. Evaluation 
is performed against manual and semi-
automatic methods using a fixed set of an-
swer labels. Results show our approach to 
be superior for those questions classified 
as having a miscellaneous answer type.
1 Introduction
Given a question, people are usually able to form 
an expectation about the type of the answer, even 
if they do not know the actual answer. An accu-
rate expectation of the answer type makes it much 
easier to select the answer from a sentence that 
contains the query words. Consider the question 
“What is the capital of Norway?” We would ex-
pect the answer to be a city and could filter out 
most of the words in the following sentence:
The landed aristocracy was virtually crushed 
by Hakon V, who reigned from 1299 to 1319, 
and Oslo became the capital of Norway, re-
placing Bergen as the principal city of the 
kingdom.
The goal of answer typing is to determine 
whether a word’s semantic type is appropriate as 
an answer for a question. Many previous ap-
proaches to answer typing, e.g., (Ittycheriah et al., 
2001; Li and Roth, 2002; Krishnan et al., 2005), 
employ a predefined set of answer types and use 
supervised learning or manually constructed rules 
to classify a question according to expected an-
swer type. A disadvantage of this approach is that 
there will always be questions whose answers do 
not belong to any of the predefined types.
Consider the question: “What are tourist attrac-
tions in Reims?” The answer may be many things: 
a church, a historic residence, a park, a famous 
intersection, a statue, etc. A common method to 
deal with this problem is to define a catch-all class. 
This class, however, tends not to be as effective as 
other answer types.
Another disadvantage of predefined answer 
types is with regard to granularity. If the types 
are too specific, they are more difficult to tag. If 
they are too general, too many candidates may be 
identified as having the appropriate type.
In contrast to previous approaches that use a su-
pervised classifier to categorize questions into a 
predefined set of types, we propose an unsuper-
vised method to dynamically construct a proba-
bilistic answer type model for each question. Such 
a model can be used to evaluate whether or not 
a word fits into the question context. For exam-
ple, given the question “What are tourist attrac-
tions in Reims?”, we would expect the appropriate 
answers to fit into the context “X is a tourist attrac-
tion.” From a corpus, we can find the words that 
appeared in this context, such as:
A-Ama Temple, Aborigine, addition, Anak 
Krakatau, archipelago, area, baseball, 
Bletchley Park, brewery, cabaret, Cairo, 
Cape Town, capital, center, ...
Using the frequency counts of these words in 
the context, we construct a probabilistic model 
to compute P (in (w, Γ) | w), the probability for a 
word w to occur in a set of contexts Γ, given an 
occurrence of w. The parameters in this model are 
obtained from a large, automatically parsed, un-
labeled corpus. By asking whether a word would 
occur in a particular context extracted from a ques-
393
tion, we avoid explicitly specifying a list of pos-
sible answer types. This has the added benefit 
of being easily adapted to different domains and 
corpora in which a list of explicit possible answer 
types may be difficult to enumerate and/or identify 
within the text.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 discusses the work related to an-
swer typing. Section 3 discusses some of the key 
concepts employed by our probabilistic model, in-
cluding word clusters and the contexts of a ques-
tion and a word. Section 4 presents our probabilis-
tic model for answer typing. Section 5 compares 
the performance of our model with that of an or-
acle and a semi-automatic system performing the 
same task. Finally, the concluding remarks in are 
made in Section 6.
2 Related Work
Light et al. (2001) performed an analysis of the 
effect of multiple answer type occurrences in a 
sentence. When multiple words of the same type 
appear in a sentence, answer typing with fixed 
types must assign each the same score. Light et 
al. found that even with perfect answer sentence 
identification, question typing, and semantic tag-
ging, a system could only achieve 59% accuracy 
over the TREC-9 questions when using their set of 
24 non-overlapping answer types. By computing 
the probability of an answer candidate occurring 
in the question contexts directly, we avoid having 
multiple candidates with the same level of appro-
priateness as answers.
There have been a variety of approaches to de-
termine the answer types, which are also known 
as Qtargets (Echihabi et al., 2003). Most previous 
approaches classify the answer type of a question 
as one of a set of predefined types.
Many systems construct the classification rules 
manually (Cui et al., 2004; Greenwood, 2004; 
Hermjakob, 2001). The rules are usually triggered 
by the presence of certain words in the question. 
For example, if a question contains “author” then 
the expected answer type is Person.
The number of answer types as well as the num-
ber of rules can vary a great deal. For example, 
(Hermjakob, 2001) used 276 rules for 122 answer 
types. Greenwood (2004), on the other hand, used 
46 answer types with unspecified number of rules.
The classification rules can also be acquired 
with supervised learning. Ittycheriah, et al. (2001) 
describe a maximum entropy based question clas-
sification scheme to classify each question as hav-
ing one of the MUC answer types. In a similar ex-
periment, Li & Roth (2002) train a question clas-
sifier based on a modified version of SNoW using 
a richer set of answer types than Ittycheriah et al.
The LCC system (Harabagiu et al., 2003) com-
bines fixed types with a novel loop-back strategy. 
In the event that a question cannot be classified as 
one of the fixed entity types or semantic concepts 
derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), the an-
swer type model backs off to a logic prover that 
uses axioms derived form WordNet, along with 
logic rules, to justify phrases as answers. Thus, the 
LCC system is able to avoid the use of a miscel-
laneous type that often exhibits poor performance. 
However, the logic prover must have sufficient ev-
idence to link the question to the answer, and gen-
eral knowledge must be encoded as axioms into 
the system. In contrast, our answer type model 
derives all of its information automatically from 
unannotated text.
Answer types are often used as filters. It was 
noted in (Radev et al., 2002) that a wrong guess 
about the answer type reduces the chance for the 
system to answer the question correctly by as 
much as 17 times. The approach presented here 
is less brittle. Even if the correct candidate does 
not have the highest likelihood according to the 
model, it may still be selected when the answer 
extraction module takes into account other factors 
such as the proximity to the matched keywords. 
Furthermore, a probabilistic model makes it eas-
ier to integrate the answer type scores with scores 
computed by other components in a question an-
swering system in a principled fashion.
3 Resources
Before introducing our model, we first describe 
the resources used in the model.
3.1 Word Clusters
Natural language data is extremely sparse. Word 
clusters are a way of coping with data sparseness 
by abstracting a given word to a class of related 
words. Clusters, as used by our probabilistic an-
swer typing system, play a role similar to that of 
named entity types. Many methods exist for clus-
tering, e.g., (Brown et al., 1990; Cutting et al., 
1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Karypis et al., 1999).
We used the Clustering By Committee (CBC)
394
Table 1: Words and their clusters
Word	Clusters
suite	software, network, wireless,... rooms, bathrooms, restrooms, ... meeting room, conference room, ...
ghost	rabbit, squirrel, duck, elephant, frog, ... goblins, ghosts, vampires, ghouls, ... punk, reggae, folk, pop, hip-pop, ... huge, larger, vast, significant, ... coming-of-age, true-life, ...
	clouds, cloud, fog, haze, mist, ...
algorithm (Pantel and Lin, 2002) on a 10 GB En-
glish text corpus to obtain 3607 clusters. The fol-
lowing is an example cluster generated by CBC:
tension, anger, anxiety, tensions, frustration, 
resentment, uncertainty, confusion, conflict, 
discontent, insecurity, controversy, unease, 
bitterness, dispute, disagreement, nervous-
ness, sadness, despair, animosity, hostility, 
outrage, discord, pessimism, anguish, ...
In the clustering generated by CBC, a word may 
belong to multiple clusters. The clusters to which 
a word belongs often represent the senses of the 
word. Table 1 shows two example words and their 
clusters.
3.2 Contexts
The context in which a word appears often im-
poses constraints on the semantic type of the word. 
This basic idea has been exploited by many pro-
posals for distributional similarity and clustering, 
e.g., (Church and Hanks, 1989; Lin, 1998; Pereira 
et al., 1993).
Similar to Lin and Pantel (2001), we define 
the contexts of a word to be the undirected paths 
in dependency trees involving that word at either 
the beginning or the end. The following diagram 
shows an example dependency tree:
obj
Which city hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics?
The links in the tree represent dependency rela-
tionships. The direction of a link is from the head 
to the modifier in the relationship. Labels associ-
ated with the links represent types of relations.
In a context, the word itself is replaced with a 
variable X. We say a word is the filler of a context 
if it replaces X. For example, the contexts for the 
word “Olympics” in the above sentence include 
the following paths:
Context of “Olympics”				Explanation
X	NN	Winter		Winter X
X	NN	1988		1988 X
X	obj	host		host X
X	obj	subj	city	city hosted X
		host		
In these paths, words are reduced to their root 
forms and proper names are reduced to their entity 
tags (we used MUC7 named entity tags).
Paths allow us to balance the specificity of con-
texts and the sparseness of data. Longer paths typ-
ically impose stricter constraints on the slot fillers. 
However, they tend to have fewer occurrences, 
making them more prone to errors arising from 
data sparseness. We have restricted the path length 
to two (involving at most three words) and require 
the two ends of the path to be nouns.
We parsed the AQUAINT corpus (3GB) with 
Minipar (Lin, 2001) and collected the frequency 
counts of words appearing in various contexts. 
Parsing and database construction is performed 
off-line as the database is identical for all ques-
tions. We extracted 527,768 contexts that ap-
peared at least 25 times in the corpus. An example 
context and its fillers are shown in Figure 1.

3.2.1 Question Contexts
To build a probabilistic model for answer typ-
ing, we extract a set of contexts, called question 
contexts, from a question. An answer is expected 
to be a plausible filler of the question contexts. 
Question contexts are extracted from a question 
with two rules. First, if the wh-word in a ques-
tion has a trace in the parse tree, the question con-
texts are the contexts of the trace. For example, the
det	subj
det
NN
NN
395
question “What do most tourists visit in Reims?” 
is parsed as:
i	in
Whati do most tourists visit ei in Reims?
The symbol ei is the trace of whati. Minipar 
generates the trace to indicate that the word what 
is the object of visit in the deep structure of the 
sentence. The following question contexts are ex-
tracted from the above question:
Context					Explanation
X	obj	visit	subj	tourist	tourist visits X
X	obj	visit	in	Reims	visit X in Reims
The second rule deals with situations where 
the wh-word is a determiner, as in the question 
“Which city hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics?” 
(the parse tree for which is shown in section 3.2). 
In such cases, the question contexts consist of a 
single context involving the noun that is modified 
by the determiner. The context for the above sen-
subj
tence is X city , corresponding to the sentence
“X is a city.” This context is used because the 
question explicitly states that the desired answer is 
a city. The context overrides the other contexts be-
cause the question explicitly states the desired an-
swer type. Experimental results have shown that 
using this context in conjunction with other con-
texts extracted from the question produces lower 
performance than using this context alone.
In the event that a context extracted from a ques-
tion is not found in the database, we shorten the 
context in one of two ways. We start by replac-
ing the word at the end of the path with a wildcard 
that matches any word. If this fails to yield en-
tries in the context database, we shorten the con-
text to length one and replace the end word with 
automatically determined similar words instead of 
a wildcard.
3.2.2 Candidate Contexts
Candidate contexts are very similar in form to 
question contexts, save for one important differ-
ence. Candidate contexts are extracted from the 
parse trees of the answer candidates rather than the 
question. In natural language, some words may 
be polysemous. For example, Washington may re-
fer to a person, a city, or a state. The occurrences 
of Washington in “Washington’s descendants” and 
“suburban Washington” should not be given the 
same score when the question is seeking a loca-
tion. Given that the sense of a word is largely de-
termined by its local context (Choueka and Lusig-
nan, 1985), candidate contexts allow the model to 
take into account the candidate answers’ senses 
implicitly.
4 Probabilistic Model
The goal of an answer typing model is to evalu-
ate the appropriateness of a candidate word as an 
answer to the question. If we assume that a set 
of answer candidates is provided to our model by 
some means (e.g., words comprising documents 
extracted by an information retrieval engine), we 
wish to compute the value P(in(w, FQ) I w). That 
is, the appropriateness of a candidate answer w is 
proportional to the probability that it will occur in 
the question contexts FQ extracted from the ques-
tion.
To mitigate data sparseness, we can introduce 
a hidden variable C that represents the clusters to 
which the candidate answer may belong. As a can-
didate may belong to multiple clusters, we obtain:
P(in(w, PQ) Iw) = E P(in(w, PQ), CIw) (1)
C
=E P(CIw)P(in(w, PQ)IC, w) (2)
C
Given that a word appears, we assume that it has 
the same probability to appear in a context as all 
other words in the same cluster. Therefore:
P(in(w, PQ) IC, w) � P(in(C, PQ) IC) (3)
We can now rewrite the equation in (2) as: 
P(in(w,PQ)Iw) Pz� E P(CIw)P(in(C,PQ)IC) (4)
C
This equation splits our model into two parts: 
one models which clusters a word belongs to and 
the other models how appropriate a cluster is to 
the question contexts. When FQ consists of multi-
ple contexts, we make the naive Bayes assumption 
that each individual context -yQ E FQ is indepen-
dent of all other contexts given the cluster C.
P(in(w,PQ)Iw) Pz� E P(CIw)H P(in(C,γQ)IC) (5)
C γQ∈ΓQ
Equation (5) needs the parameters P(Clw) and 
P(in(C, -yQ) IC), neither of which are directly 
available from the context-filler database. We will 
discuss the estimation of these parameters in Sec-
tion 4.2.

4.1 Using Candidate Contexts
The previous model assigns the same likelihood to 
every instance of a given word. As we noted in 
section 3.2.2, a word may be polysemous. To take 
into account a word’s context, we can instead com-
pute P(in(w, FQ)Iw, in(w, Fw)), where Fw is the 
set of contexts for the candidate word w in a re-
trieved passage.
By introducing word clusters as intermediate 
variables as before and making a similar assump-
tion as in equation (3), we obtain:
P(in(w, rQ)lw, in(w, rw))
= E P(in(w, rQ), Cl w, in(w, rw))	(6)
C
E�	P(Clw, in(w, rw))P(in(C, rQ)lC)	(7)
C
Like equation (4), equation (7) partitions the 
model into two parts. Unlike P(CIw) in equation 
(4), the probability of the cluster is now based on 
the particular occurrence of the word in the candi-
date contexts. It can be estimated by:
P(Clw,in(w,rw))
= P(in(w, rw) lw, C)P(w, C)	(8)
P(in(w,rw)lw)P(w)
H P(in(w, 7w)l w, C)
7w Erw
H P(in(w,7w)lw)
7wErw
4.2 Estimating Parameters
Our probabilistic model requires the parameters 
P(CIw), P(CIw, in(w, -y)), and P(in(C,-y) IC), 
where w is a word, C is a cluster that w belongs to, 
and -y is a question or candidate context. This sec-
tion explains how these parameters are estimated 
without using labeled data.
The context-filler database described in Sec-
tion 3.2 provides the joint and marginal fre-
quency counts of contexts and words (Iin(-y, w)I, 
Iin(*,-y)I and Iin(w,*)I). These counts al-
low us to compute the probabilities P(in(w,-y)), 
P(in(w, *)), and P(in(*,-y)). We can also com-
pute P(in(w, -y) Iw), which is smoothed with add- 
one smoothing (see equation (11) in Figure 2). 
The estimation of P(CIw) presents a challenge. 
We have no corpus from which we can directly 
measure P(CIw) because word instances are not 
labeled with their clusters.
P(in(w, 7) lw) = lin(w, 7) l + P(in(*,7))	(11)

Figure 2: Probability estimation
We use the average weighted “guesses” of the 
top similar words of w to compute P(CIw) (see 
equation 13). The intuition is that if w' and w 
are similar words, P(CIw') and P(CIw) tend 
to have similar values. Since we do not know 
P(CIw') either, we substitute it with uniform dis-
tribution P,,(CIw') as in equation (12) of Fig-
ure 2. Although P,, (CIw') is a very crude guess, 
the weighted average of a set of such guesses can 
often be quite accurate.
The similarities between words are obtained as 
a byproduct of the CBC algorithm. For each word, 
we use S(w) to denote the top-n most similar 
words (n=50 in our experiments) and sim(w, w') 
to denote the similarity between words w and w'. 
The following is a sample similar word list for the 
word suit:
S(suit) _ {lawsuit 0.49, suits 0.47, com-
plaint 0.29, lawsuits 0.27, jacket 0.25, coun-
tersuit 0.24, counterclaim 0.24, pants 0.24, 
trousers 0.22, shirt 0.21, slacks 0.21, case 
0.21, pantsuit 0.21, shirts 0.20, sweater 0.20, 
coat 0.20, ...1
The estimation for P(CIw, in(w, -yw)) is sim-
ilar to that of P(CIw) except that instead of all
w' E S(w), we instead use {w'Iw' E S(w) n
in (w', -yw )�. By only looking at a particular con-
text -yw, we may obtain a different distribution over 
C than P(CIw) specifies. In the event that the data 
are too sparse to estimate P(CIw, in(w, -yw)), we 
fall back to using P(CIw).
P(in(C,-y)IC) is computed in (14) by assum-
ing each instance of w contains a fractional in-
stance of C and the fractional count is P(CIw). 
Again, add-one smoothing is used.

Table 2: Summary of Results
5 Experimental Setup & Results
We evaluate our answer typing system by using 
it to filter the contents of documents retrieved by 
the information retrieval portion of a question an-
swering system. Each answer candidate in the set 
of documents is scored by the answer typing sys-
tem and the list is sorted in descending order of 
score. We treat the system as a filter and observe 
the proportion of candidates that must be accepted 
by the filter so that at least one correct answer is 
accepted. A model that allows a low percentage 
of candidates to pass while still allowing at least 
one correct answer through is favorable to a model 
in which a high number of candidates must pass. 
This represents an intrinsic rather than extrinsic 
evaluation (Moll´a and Hutchinson, 2003) that we 
believe illustrates the usefulness of our model.
The evaluation data consist of 154 questions 
from the TREC-2003 QA Track (Voorhees, 2003) 
satisfying the following criteria, along with the top 
10 documents returned for each question as iden-
tified by NIST using the PRISE1 search engine.
•	the question begins with What, Which, or 
Who. We restricted the evaluation such ques-
tions because our system is designed to deal 
with questions whose answer types are often 
semantically open-ended noun phrases.
•	There exists entry for the question in the an-
swer patterns provided by Ken Litkowski2.
•	One of the top-10 documents returned by 
PRISE contains a correct answer.
We compare the performance of our prob-
abilistic model with that of two other sys-
tems. Both comparison systems make use of a 
small, predefined set of manually-assigned MUC-
7 named-entity types (location, person, organiza-
tion, cardinal, percent, date, time, duration, mea-
sure, money) augmented with thing-name (proper
1www.itl.nist.gov/iad/894.02/works/papers/zp2/zp2.html 
2trec.nist.gov/data/qa/2003 qadata/03QA.tasks/t12.pats.txt
names of inanimate objects) and miscellaneous 
(a catch-all answer type of all other candidates). 
Some examples of thing-name are Guinness Book 
of World Records, Thriller, Mars Pathfinder, and 
Grey Cup. Examples of miscellaneous answers are 
copper, oil, red, and iris.
The differences in the comparison systems is 
with respect to how entity types are assigned to the 
words in the candidate documents. We make use 
of the ANNIE (Maynard et al., 2002) named entity 
recognition system, along with a manual assigned 
“oracle” strategy, to assign types to candidate an-
swers. In each case, the score for a candidate is 
either 1 if it is tagged as the same type as the ques-
tion or 0 otherwise. With this scoring scheme pro-
ducing a sorted list we can compute the probability 
of the first correct answer appearing at rank R = k 
as follows:
k-2
T�-77 t —
c—i c (15)
11 t — i t—k+1
where t is the number of unique candidate answers 
that are of the appropriate type and c is the number 
of unique candidate answers that are correct.
Using the probabilities in equation (15), we 
compute the expected rank, E(R), of the first cor-
rect answer of a given question in the system as:
kP(R = k) (16)
Answer candidates are the set of ANNIE- 
identified tokens with stop words and punctuation 
removed. This yields between 900 and 8000 can-
didates for each question, depending on the top 10 
documents returned by PRISE. The oracle system 
represents an upper bound on using the predefined 
set of answer types. The ANNIE system repre-
sents a more realistic expectation of performance.
The median percentage of candidates that are 
accepted by a filter over the questions of our eval-
uation data provides one measure of performance 
and is preferred to the average because of the ef-
fect of large values on the average. In QA, a sys-
tem accepting 60% of the candidates is not signif-
icantly better or worse than one accepting 100%,

Table 3: Detailed breakdown of performance
but the effect on average is quite high. Another 
measure is to observe the number of questions 
with at least one correct answer in the top N% for 
various values of N. By examining the number of 
correct answers found in the top N% we can better 
understand what an effective cutoff would be.
The overall results of our comparison can be 
found in Table 2. We have added the results of 
a system that scores candidates based on their fre-
quency within the document as a comparison with 
a simple, yet effective, strategy. The second col-
umn is the median percentage of where the highest 
scored correct answer appears in the sorted candi-
date list. Low percentage values mean the answer 
is usually found high in the sorted list. The re-
maining columns list the number of questions that 
have a correct answer somewhere in the top N% 
of their sorted lists. This is meant to show the ef-
fects of imposing a strict cutoff prior to running 
the answer type model.
The oracle system performs best, as it bene-
fits from both manual question classification and 
manual entity tagging. If entity assignment is 
performed by an automatic system (as it is for 
ANNIE), the performance drops noticeably. Our 
probabilistic model performs better than ANNIE 
and achieves approximately 2/3 of the perfor-
mance of the oracle system. Table 2 also shows 
that the use of candidate contexts increases the 
performance of our answer type model.
Table 3 shows the performance of the oracle 
system, our model, and the ANNIE system broken 
down by manually-assigned answer types. Due 
to insufficient numbers of questions, the cardinal, 
percent, time, duration, measure, and money types 
are combined into an “Other” category. When 
compared with the oracle system, our model per-
forms worse overall for questions of all types ex-
cept for those seeking miscellaneous answers. For 
miscellaneous questions, the oracle identifies all 
tokens that do not belong to one of the other 
known categories as possible answers. For all 
questions of non-miscellaneous type, only a small 
subset of the candidates are marked appropriate. 
In particular, our model performs worse than the 
oracle for questions seeking persons and thing- 
names. Person questions often seek rare person 
names, which occur in few contexts and are diffi-
cult to reliably cluster. Thing-name questions are 
easy for a human to identify but difficult for au-
tomatic system to identify. Thing-names are a di-
verse category and are not strongly associated with 
any identifying contexts.
Our model outperforms the ANNIE system in 
general, and for questions seeking organizations, 
thing-names, and miscellaneous targets in partic-
ular. ANNIE may have low coverage on organi-
zation names, resulting in reduced performance. 
Like the oracle, ANNIE treats all candidates not 
assigned one of the categories as appropriate for 
miscellaneous questions. Because ANNIE cannot 
identify thing-names, they are treated as miscella-
neous. ANNIE shows low performance on thing- 
names because words incorrectly assigned types 
are sorted to the bottom of the list for miscella-
neous and thing-name questions. If a correct an-
swer is incorrectly assigned a type it will be sorted 
near the bottom, resulting in a poor score.

6 Conclusions
We have presented an unsupervised probabilistic 
answer type model. Our model uses contexts de-
rived from the question and the candidate answer 
to calculate the appropriateness of a candidate an-
swer. Statistics gathered from a large corpus of 
text are used in the calculation, and the model is 
constructed to exploit these statistics without be-
ing overly specific or overly general.
The method presented here avoids the use of an 
explicit list of answer types. Explicit answer types 
can exhibit poor performance, especially for those 
questions not fitting one of the types. They must 
also be redefined when either the domain or corpus 
substantially changes. By avoiding their use, our 
answer typing method may be easier to adapt to 
different corpora and question answering domains 
(such as bioinformatics).
In addition to operating as a stand-alone answer 
typing component, our system can be combined 
with other existing answer typing strategies, es-
pecially in situations in which a catch-all answer 
type is used. Our experimental results show that 
our probabilistic model outperforms the oracle and 
a system using automatic named entity recognition 
under such circumstances. The performance of 
our model is better than that of the semi-automatic 
system, which is a better indication of the expected 
performance of a comparable real-world answer 
typing system.
