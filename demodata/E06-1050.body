Abstract
All questions are implicitly associated
with an expected answer type. Unlike
previous approaches that require a prede-
ﬁned set of question types, we present
a method for dynamically constructing
a probability-based answer type model
for each different question. Our model
evaluates the appropriateness of a poten-
tial answer by the probability that it ﬁts
into the question contexts. Evaluation
is performed against manual and semi-
automatic methods using a ﬁxed set of an-
swer labels. Results show our approach to
be superior for those questions classiﬁed
as having a miscellaneous answer type.
1 Introduction
Given a question, people are usually able to form
an expectation about the type of the answer, even
if they do not know the actual answer. An accu-
rate expectation of the answer type makes it much
easier to select the answer from a sentence that
contains the query words. Consider the question
“What is the capital of Norway?” We would ex-
pect the answer to be a city and could ﬁlter out
most of the words in the following sentence:
The landed aristocracy was virtually crushed
by Hakon V, who reigned from 1299 to 1319,
and Oslo became the capital of Norway, re-
placing Bergen as the principal city of the
kingdom.
The goal of answer typing is to determine
whether a word’s semantic type is appropriate as
an answer for a question. Many previous ap-
proaches to answer typing, e.g., (Ittycheriah et al.,
2001; Li and Roth, 2002; Krishnan et al., 2005),
employ a predeﬁned set of answer types and use
supervised learning or manually constructed rules
to classify a question according to expected an-
swer type. A disadvantage of this approach is that
there will always be questions whose answers do
not belong to any of the predeﬁned types.
Consider the question: “What are tourist attrac-
tions in Reims?” The answer may be many things:
a church, a historic residence, a park, a famous
intersection, a statue, etc. A common method to
deal with this problem is to deﬁne a catch-all class.
This class, however, tends not to be as effective as
other answer types.
Another disadvantage of predeﬁned answer
types is with regard to granularity. If the types
are too speciﬁc, they are more difﬁcult to tag. If
they are too general, too many candidates may be
identiﬁed as having the appropriate type.
In contrast to previous approaches that use a su-
pervised classiﬁer to categorize questions into a
predeﬁned set of types, we propose an unsuper-
vised method to dynamically construct a proba-
bilistic answer type model for each question. Such
a model can be used to evaluate whether or not
a word ﬁts into the question context. For exam-
ple, given the question “What are tourist attrac-
tions in Reims?”, we would expect the appropriate
answers to ﬁt into the context “X is a tourist attrac-
tion.” From a corpus, we can ﬁnd the words that
appeared in this context, such as:
A-Ama Temple, Aborigine, addition, Anak
Krakatau, archipelago, area, baseball,
Bletchley Park, brewery, cabaret, Cairo,
Cape Town, capital, center, ...
Using the frequency counts of these words in
the context, we construct a probabilistic model
to compute P(in(w, Γ)|w), the probability for a
word w to occur in a set of contexts Γ, given an
occurrence of w. The parameters in this model are
obtained from a large, automatically parsed, un-
labeled corpus. By asking whether a word would
occur in a particular context extracted from a ques-
393
tion, we avoid explicitly specifying a list of pos-
sible answer types. This has the added beneﬁt
of being easily adapted to different domains and
corpora in which a list of explicit possible answer
types may be difﬁcult to enumerate and/or identify
within the text.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 discusses the work related to an-
swer typing. Section 3 discusses some of the key
concepts employed by our probabilistic model, in-
cluding word clusters and the contexts of a ques-
tion and a word. Section 4 presents our probabilis-
tic model for answer typing. Section 5 compares
the performance of our model with that of an or-
acle and a semi-automatic system performing the
same task. Finally, the concluding remarks in are
made in Section 6.
2 Related Work
Light et al. (2001) performed an analysis of the
effect of multiple answer type occurrences in a
sentence. When multiple words of the same type
appear in a sentence, answer typing with ﬁxed
types must assign each the same score. Light et
al. found that even with perfect answer sentence
identiﬁcation, question typing, and semantic tag-
ging, a system could only achieve 59% accuracy
over the TREC-9 questions when using their set of
24 non-overlapping answer types. By computing
the probability of an answer candidate occurring
in the question contexts directly, we avoid having
multiple candidates with the same level of appro-
priateness as answers.
There have been a variety of approaches to de-
termine the answer types, which are also known
as Qtargets (Echihabi et al., 2003). Most previous
approaches classify the answer type of a question
as one of a set of predeﬁned types.
Many systems construct the classiﬁcation rules
manually (Cui et al., 2004; Greenwood, 2004;
Hermjakob, 2001). The rules are usually triggered
by the presence of certain words in the question.
For example, if a question contains “author” then
the expected answer type is Person.
The number of answer types as well as the num-
ber of rules can vary a great deal. For example,
(Hermjakob, 2001) used 276 rules for 122 answer
types. Greenwood (2004), on the other hand, used
46 answer types with unspeciﬁed number of rules.
The classiﬁcation rules can also be acquired
with supervised learning. Ittycheriah, et al. (2001)
describe a maximum entropy based question clas-
siﬁcation scheme to classify each question as hav-
ing one of the MUC answer types. In a similar ex-
periment, Li & Roth (2002) train a question clas-
siﬁer based on a modiﬁed version of SNoW using
a richer set of answer types than Ittycheriah et al.
The LCC system (Harabagiu et al., 2003) com-
bines ﬁxed types with a novel loop-back strategy.
In the event that a question cannot be classiﬁed as
one of the ﬁxed entity types or semantic concepts
derived from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), the an-
swer type model backs off to a logic prover that
uses axioms derived form WordNet, along with
logic rules, to justify phrases as answers. Thus, the
LCC system is able to avoid the use of a miscel-
laneous type that often exhibits poor performance.
However, the logic prover must have sufﬁcient ev-
idence to link the question to the answer, and gen-
eral knowledge must be encoded as axioms into
the system. In contrast, our answer type model
derives all of its information automatically from
unannotated text.
Answer types are often used as ﬁlters. It was
noted in (Radev et al., 2002) that a wrong guess
about the answer type reduces the chance for the
system to answer the question correctly by as
much as 17 times. The approach presented here
is less brittle. Even if the correct candidate does
not have the highest likelihood according to the
model, it may still be selected when the answer
extraction module takes into account other factors
such as the proximity to the matched keywords.
Furthermore, a probabilistic model makes it eas-
ier to integrate the answer type scores with scores
computed by other components in a question an-
swering system in a principled fashion.
3 Resources
Before introducing our model, we ﬁrst describe
the resources used in the model.
3.1 Word Clusters
Natural language data is extremely sparse. Word
clusters are a way of coping with data sparseness
by abstracting a given word to a class of related
words. Clusters, as used by our probabilistic an-
swer typing system, play a role similar to that of
named entity types. Many methods exist for clus-
tering, e.g., (Brown et al., 1990; Cutting et al.,
1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Karypis et al., 1999).
We used the Clustering By Committee (CBC)
394
Table 1: Words and their clusters
Word Clusters
suite software, network, wireless, ...
rooms, bathrooms, restrooms, ...
meeting room, conference room, ...
ghost rabbit, squirrel, duck, elephant, frog, ...
goblins, ghosts, vampires, ghouls, ...
punk, reggae, folk, pop, hip-pop, ...
huge, larger, vast, signiﬁcant, ...
coming-of-age, true-life, ...
clouds, cloud, fog, haze, mist, ...
algorithm (Pantel and Lin, 2002) on a 10 GB En-
glish text corpus to obtain 3607 clusters. The fol-
lowing is an example cluster generated by CBC:
tension, anger, anxiety, tensions, frustration,
resentment, uncertainty, confusion, conﬂict,
discontent, insecurity, controversy, unease,
bitterness, dispute, disagreement, nervous-
ness, sadness, despair, animosity, hostility,
outrage, discord, pessimism, anguish, ...
In the clustering generated by CBC, a word may
belong to multiple clusters. The clusters to which
a word belongs often represent the senses of the
word. Table 1 shows two example words and their
clusters.
3.2 Contexts
The context in which a word appears often im-
poses constraints on the semantic type of the word.
This basic idea has been exploited by many pro-
posals for distributional similarity and clustering,
e.g., (Church and Hanks, 1989; Lin, 1998; Pereira
et al., 1993).
Similar to Lin and Pantel (2001), we deﬁne
the contexts of a word to be the undirected paths
in dependency trees involving that word at either
the beginning or the end. The following diagram
shows an example dependency tree:
Which city hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics?
det subj
obj
NN
NN
det
The links in the tree represent dependency rela-
tionships. The direction of a link is from the head
to the modiﬁer in the relationship. Labels associ-
ated with the links represent types of relations.
In a context, the word itself is replaced with a
variable X. We say a word is the ﬁller of a context
if it replaces X. For example, the contexts for the
word “Olympics” in the above sentence include
the following paths:
Context of “Olympics” Explanation
X Winter
NN
Winter X
X 1988
NN
1988 X
X host
obj
host X
X host
obj
city
subj
city hosted X
In these paths, words are reduced to their root
forms and proper names are reduced to their entity
tags (we used MUC7 named entity tags).
Paths allow us to balance the speciﬁcity of con-
texts and the sparseness of data. Longer paths typ-
ically impose stricter constraints on the slot ﬁllers.
However, they tend to have fewer occurrences,
making them more prone to errors arising from
data sparseness. We have restricted the path length
to two (involving at most three words) and require
the two ends of the path to be nouns.
We parsed the AQUAINT corpus (3GB) with
Minipar (Lin, 2001) and collected the frequency
counts of words appearing in various contexts.
Parsing and database construction is performed
off-line as the database is identical for all ques-
tions. We extracted 527,768 contexts that ap-
peared at least 25 times in the corpus. An example
context and its ﬁllers are shown in Figure 1.

3.2.1 Question Contexts
To build a probabilistic model for answer typ-
ing, we extract a set of contexts, called question
contexts, from a question. An answer is expected
to be a plausible ﬁller of the question contexts.
Question contexts are extracted from a question
with two rules. First, if the wh-word in a ques-
tion has a trace in the parse tree, the question con-
texts are the contexts of the trace. For example, the
395
question “What do most tourists visit in Reims?”
is parsed as:
Whati
do most tourists visit ei
in Reims?
det
i
subj
det
obj
in
The symbol ei is the trace of whati. Minipar
generates the trace to indicate that the word what
is the object of visit in the deep structure of the
sentence. The following question contexts are ex-
tracted from the above question:
Context Explanation
X visit tourist
obj subj
tourist visits X
X visit Reims
obj in
visit X in Reims
The second rule deals with situations where
the wh-word is a determiner, as in the question
“Which city hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics?”
(the parse tree for which is shown in section 3.2).
In such cases, the question contexts consist of a
single context involving the noun that is modiﬁed
by the determiner. The context for the above sen-
tence is X city
subj
, corresponding to the sentence
“X is a city.” This context is used because the
question explicitly states that the desired answer is
a city. The context overrides the other contexts be-
cause the question explicitly states the desired an-
swer type. Experimental results have shown that
using this context in conjunction with other con-
texts extracted from the question produces lower
performance than using this context alone.
In the event that a context extracted from a ques-
tion is not found in the database, we shorten the
context in one of two ways. We start by replac-
ing the word at the end of the path with a wildcard
that matches any word. If this fails to yield en-
tries in the context database, we shorten the con-
text to length one and replace the end word with
automatically determined similar words instead of
a wildcard.
3.2.2 Candidate Contexts
Candidate contexts are very similar in form to
question contexts, save for one important differ-
ence. Candidate contexts are extracted from the
parse trees of the answer candidates rather than the
question. In natural language, some words may
be polysemous. For example, Washington may re-
fer to a person, a city, or a state. The occurrences
of Washington in “Washington’s descendants” and
“suburban Washington” should not be given the
same score when the question is seeking a loca-
tion. Given that the sense of a word is largely de-
termined by its local context (Choueka and Lusig-
nan, 1985), candidate contexts allow the model to
take into account the candidate answers’ senses
implicitly.
4 Probabilistic Model
The goal of an answer typing model is to evalu-
ate the appropriateness of a candidate word as an
answer to the question. If we assume that a set
of answer candidates is provided to our model by
some means (e.g., words comprising documents
extracted by an information retrieval engine), we
wish to compute the value P(in(w, ΓQ)|w). That
is, the appropriateness of a candidate answer w is
proportional to the probability that it will occur in
the question contexts ΓQ extracted from the ques-
tion.
To mitigate data sparseness, we can introduce
a hidden variable C that represents the clusters to
which the candidate answer may belong. As a can-
didate may belong to multiple clusters, we obtain:
P(in(w, ΓQ)|w) =
X
C
P(in(w, ΓQ), C|w) (1)
=
X
C
P(C|w)P(in(w, ΓQ)|C, w) (2)
Given that a word appears, we assume that it has
the same probability to appear in a context as all
other words in the same cluster. Therefore:
P(in(w, ΓQ)|C, w) ≈ P(in(C, ΓQ)|C) (3)
We can now rewrite the equation in (2) as:
P(in(w, ΓQ)|w) ≈
X
C
P(C|w)P(in(C, ΓQ)|C) (4)
This equation splits our model into two parts:
one models which clusters a word belongs to and
the other models how appropriate a cluster is to
the question contexts. When ΓQ consists of multi-
ple contexts, we make the na¨ıve Bayes assumption
that each individual context γQ ∈ ΓQ is indepen-
dent of all other contexts given the cluster C.
P(in(w, ΓQ)|w) ≈
X
C
P(C|w)
Y
γQ∈ΓQ
P(in(C, γQ)|C) (5)
Equation (5) needs the parameters P(C|w) and
P(in(C, γQ)|C), neither of which are directly
available from the context-ﬁller database. We will
discuss the estimation of these parameters in Sec-
tion 4.2.

4.1 Using Candidate Contexts
The previous model assigns the same likelihood to
every instance of a given word. As we noted in
section 3.2.2, a word may be polysemous. To take
into account a word’s context, we can instead com-
pute P(in(w, ΓQ)|w, in(w, Γw)), where Γw is the
set of contexts for the candidate word w in a re-
trieved passage.
By introducing word clusters as intermediate
variables as before and making a similar assump-
tion as in equation (3), we obtain:
P(in(w, ΓQ)|w, in(w, Γw))
=
X
C
P(in(w, ΓQ), C|w, in(w, Γw)) (6)
≈
X
C
P(C|w, in(w, Γw))P(in(C, ΓQ)|C) (7)
Like equation (4), equation (7) partitions the
model into two parts. Unlike P(C|w) in equation
(4), the probability of the cluster is now based on
the particular occurrence of the word in the candi-
date contexts. It can be estimated by:
P(C|w, in(w, Γw))
=
P(in(w, Γw)|w, C)P(w, C)
P(in(w, Γw)|w)P(w)
(8)

4.2 Estimating Parameters
Our probabilistic model requires the parameters
P(C|w), P(C|w, in(w, γ)), and P(in(C, γ)|C),
where w is a word, C is a cluster that w belongs to,
and γ is a question or candidate context. This sec-
tion explains how these parameters are estimated
without using labeled data.
The context-ﬁller database described in Sec-
tion 3.2 provides the joint and marginal fre-
quency counts of contexts and words (|in(γ, w)|,
|in(∗, γ)| and |in(w, ∗)|). These counts al-
low us to compute the probabilities P(in(w, γ)),
P(in(w, ∗)), and P(in(∗, γ)). We can also com-
pute P(in(w, γ)|w), which is smoothed with add-
one smoothing (see equation (11) in Figure 2).
The estimation of P(C|w) presents a challenge.
We have no corpus from which we can directly
measure P(C|w) because word instances are not
labeled with their clusters.
P(in(w, γ)|w) =
|in(w, γ)| + P(in(∗, γ))
|in(w, ∗)| + 1
(11)
Pu(C|w) =
(
1
|{C |w∈C }|
if w ∈ C,
0 otherwise
(12)
P(C|w) =
X
w ∈S(w)
sim(w, w ) × Pu(C|w )
X
{C |w∈C },
w ∈S(w)
sim(w, w ) × Pu(C |w )
(13)
P(in(C, γ)|C) =
X
w ∈C
P(C|w ) × |in(w , γ)| + P(in(∗, γ))
X
w ∈C
P(C|w ) × |in(w , ∗)| + 1
(14)
Figure 2: Probability estimation
We use the average weighted “guesses” of the
top similar words of w to compute P(C|w) (see
equation 13). The intuition is that if w and w
are similar words, P(C|w ) and P(C|w) tend
to have similar values. Since we do not know
P(C|w ) either, we substitute it with uniform dis-
tribution Pu(C|w ) as in equation (12) of Fig-
ure 2. Although Pu(C|w ) is a very crude guess,
the weighted average of a set of such guesses can
often be quite accurate.
The similarities between words are obtained as
a byproduct of the CBC algorithm. For each word,
we use S(w) to denote the top-n most similar
words (n=50 in our experiments) and sim(w, w )
to denote the similarity between words w and w .
The following is a sample similar word list for the
word suit:
S(suit) = {lawsuit 0.49, suits 0.47, com-
plaint 0.29, lawsuits 0.27, jacket 0.25, coun-
tersuit 0.24, counterclaim 0.24, pants 0.24,
trousers 0.22, shirt 0.21, slacks 0.21, case
0.21, pantsuit 0.21, shirts 0.20, sweater 0.20,
coat 0.20, ...}
The estimation for P(C|w, in(w, γw)) is sim-
ilar to that of P(C|w) except that instead of all
w ∈ S(w), we instead use {w |w ∈ S(w) ∧
in(w , γw)}. By only looking at a particular con-
text γw, we may obtain a different distribution over
C than P(C|w) speciﬁes. In the event that the data
are too sparse to estimate P(C|w, in(w, γw)), we
fall back to using P(C|w).
P(in(C, γ)|C) is computed in (14) by assum-
ing each instance of w contains a fractional in-
stance of C and the fractional count is P(C|w).
Again, add-one smoothing is used.

Table 2: Summary of Results
5 Experimental Setup & Results
We evaluate our answer typing system by using
it to ﬁlter the contents of documents retrieved by
the information retrieval portion of a question an-
swering system. Each answer candidate in the set
of documents is scored by the answer typing sys-
tem and the list is sorted in descending order of
score. We treat the system as a ﬁlter and observe
the proportion of candidates that must be accepted
by the ﬁlter so that at least one correct answer is
accepted. A model that allows a low percentage
of candidates to pass while still allowing at least
one correct answer through is favorable to a model
in which a high number of candidates must pass.
This represents an intrinsic rather than extrinsic
evaluation (Moll´a and Hutchinson, 2003) that we
believe illustrates the usefulness of our model.
The evaluation data consist of 154 questions
from the TREC-2003 QA Track (Voorhees, 2003)
satisfying the following criteria, along with the top
10 documents returned for each question as iden-
tiﬁed by NIST using the PRISE1 search engine.
• the question begins with What, Which, or
Who. We restricted the evaluation such ques-
tions because our system is designed to deal
with questions whose answer types are often
semantically open-ended noun phrases.
• There exists entry for the question in the an-
swer patterns provided by Ken Litkowski2.
• One of the top-10 documents returned by
PRISE contains a correct answer.
We compare the performance of our prob-
abilistic model with that of two other sys-
tems. Both comparison systems make use of a
small, predeﬁned set of manually-assigned MUC-
7 named-entity types (location, person, organiza-
tion, cardinal, percent, date, time, duration, mea-
sure, money) augmented with thing-name (proper

trec.nist.gov/data/qa/2003 qadata/03QA.tasks/t12.pats.txt
names of inanimate objects) and miscellaneous
(a catch-all answer type of all other candidates).
Some examples of thing-name are Guinness Book
of World Records, Thriller, Mars Pathﬁnder, and
Grey Cup. Examples of miscellaneous answers are
copper, oil, red, and iris.
The differences in the comparison systems is
with respect to how entity types are assigned to the
words in the candidate documents. We make use
of the ANNIE (Maynard et al., 2002) named entity
recognition system, along with a manual assigned
“oracle” strategy, to assign types to candidate an-
swers. In each case, the score for a candidate is
either 1 if it is tagged as the same type as the ques-
tion or 0 otherwise. With this scoring scheme pro-
ducing a sorted list we can compute the probability
of the ﬁrst correct answer appearing at rank R = k
as follows:
P(R = k) =
k−2Y
i=0
„
t − c − i
t − i
«
c
t − k + 1
(15)
where t is the number of unique candidate answers
that are of the appropriate type and c is the number
of unique candidate answers that are correct.
Using the probabilities in equation (15), we
compute the expected rank, E(R), of the ﬁrst cor-
rect answer of a given question in the system as:
E(R) =
t−c+1X
k=1
kP(R = k) (16)
Answer candidates are the set of ANNIE-
identiﬁed tokens with stop words and punctuation
removed. This yields between 900 and 8000 can-
didates for each question, depending on the top 10
documents returned by PRISE. The oracle system
represents an upper bound on using the predeﬁned
set of answer types. The ANNIE system repre-
sents a more realistic expectation of performance.
The median percentage of candidates that are
accepted by a ﬁlter over the questions of our eval-
uation data provides one measure of performance
and is preferred to the average because of the ef-
fect of large values on the average. In QA, a sys-
tem accepting 60% of the candidates is not signif-
icantly better or worse than one accepting 100%,

with at least one correct answer in the top N% for
various values of N. By examining the number of
correct answers found in the top N% we can better
understand what an effective cutoff would be.
The overall results of our comparison can be
found in Table 2. We have added the results of
a system that scores candidates based on their fre-
quency within the document as a comparison with
a simple, yet effective, strategy. The second col-
umn is the median percentage of where the highest
scored correct answer appears in the sorted candi-
date list. Low percentage values mean the answer
is usually found high in the sorted list. The re-
maining columns list the number of questions that
have a correct answer somewhere in the top N%
of their sorted lists. This is meant to show the ef-
fects of imposing a strict cutoff prior to running
the answer type model.
The oracle system performs best, as it bene-
ﬁts from both manual question classiﬁcation and
manual entity tagging. If entity assignment is
performed by an automatic system (as it is for
ANNIE), the performance drops noticeably. Our
probabilistic model performs better than ANNIE
and achieves approximately 2/3 of the perfor-
mance of the oracle system. Table 2 also shows
that the use of candidate contexts increases the
performance of our answer type model.
Table 3 shows the performance of the oracle
system, our model, and the ANNIE system broken
down by manually-assigned answer types. Due
to insufﬁcient numbers of questions, the cardinal,
percent, time, duration, measure, and money types
are combined into an “Other” category. When
compared with the oracle system, our model per-
forms worse overall for questions of all types ex-
cept for those seeking miscellaneous answers. For
miscellaneous questions, the oracle identiﬁes all
tokens that do not belong to one of the other
known categories as possible answers. For all
questions of non-miscellaneous type, only a small
subset of the candidates are marked appropriate.
In particular, our model performs worse than the
oracle for questions seeking persons and thing-
names. Person questions often seek rare person
names, which occur in few contexts and are difﬁ-
cult to reliably cluster. Thing-name questions are
easy for a human to identify but difﬁcult for au-
tomatic system to identify. Thing-names are a di-
verse category and are not strongly associated with
any identifying contexts.
Our model outperforms the ANNIE system in
general, and for questions seeking organizations,
thing-names, and miscellaneous targets in partic-
ular. ANNIE may have low coverage on organi-
zation names, resulting in reduced performance.
Like the oracle, ANNIE treats all candidates not
assigned one of the categories as appropriate for
miscellaneous questions. Because ANNIE cannot
identify thing-names, they are treated as miscella-
neous. ANNIE shows low performance on thing-
names because words incorrectly assigned types
are sorted to the bottom of the list for miscella-
neous and thing-name questions. If a correct an-
swer is incorrectly assigned a type it will be sorted
near the bottom, resulting in a poor score.

6 Conclusions
We have presented an unsupervised probabilistic
answer type model. Our model uses contexts de-
rived from the question and the candidate answer
to calculate the appropriateness of a candidate an-
swer. Statistics gathered from a large corpus of
text are used in the calculation, and the model is
constructed to exploit these statistics without be-
ing overly speciﬁc or overly general.
The method presented here avoids the use of an
explicit list of answer types. Explicit answer types
can exhibit poor performance, especially for those
questions not ﬁtting one of the types. They must
also be redeﬁned when either the domain or corpus
substantially changes. By avoiding their use, our
answer typing method may be easier to adapt to
different corpora and question answering domains
(such as bioinformatics).
In addition to operating as a stand-alone answer
typing component, our system can be combined
with other existing answer typing strategies, es-
pecially in situations in which a catch-all answer
type is used. Our experimental results show that
our probabilistic model outperforms the oracle and
a system using automatic named entity recognition
under such circumstances. The performance of
our model is better than that of the semi-automatic
system, which is a better indication of the expected
performance of a comparable real-world answer
typing system.
