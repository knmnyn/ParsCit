<CENTER><H1>ParsCit: An open-source CRF Reference String Parsing Package</H1></CENTER>

<P>This is the home page of the ParsCit project, which performs two tasks: 1) reference string parsing, sometimes also called citation parsing or
citation extraction, and 2) logical structure parsing of scienfific documents.  It is architected as a supervised machine
learning procedure that uses Conditional Random Fields as its learning
mechanism.  You can download the code below, parse strings online, or
send batch jobs to our web service (coming soon!).  The code contains
both the training data, feature generator and shell scripts to connect
the system to a web service (used here too).  </P>

<P>Some definitions (thanks to Robert Dale):
<DL>
  <DT>Reference String:</DT><DD>A text string in the bibliography or reference section of a work, usually at the end of the document that refers to a unique document.  Usually occurs with other reference strings that point to other documents. May also appear as footnotes.</DD>
  <DT>Citation:</DT><DD>A text string (usually explicit) in the document body that points to a corresponding reference string at the end of the document.  Several citations may co-refer to a single reference string.</DD>
  <DT>Document Logical Structure:</DT><DD> A hierarchy of logical components, for example, titles, authors, affiliations, abstracts, sections, etc., according to (Mao, Rosenfeld, & Kanungo, 2003).<BR>
       Our logical structure is more comprehensive, comprising not only header metadata and references, but also the logical structure of the internals of the document -- sections, subsections, figures, tables, equations, footnotes and captions. </DD>
</DL>

<P>This project deals with the problem of parsing the reference
strings and parsing the logical structure of a document.  The first task is handled by a module with the
project namesake, ParsCit, and the second task by a separate module
SectLabel.  Other projects related to ParsCit (some here in WING, some
elsewhere) with identifying and linking citations to reference
strings).

<!-- FAQ  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<A name="faq"></a><H2>FAQ</H2>
<DL>
<DT>What is the difference of SectLabel and previous ParsHed?</DT>
<DD>SectLabel is a newly-developed module that further extends ParsHed in functionalities. It not only classifies header metadata, but analyzes full documents to output the logical structure of the internals of the document -- sections, subsections, figures, tables, equations, footnotes and captions. <BR>
     For compatible issues, we still keep ParsHed module in our source code and returning results.
</DD>

<DT>What is "genericHeader" in the output of SectLabel?/DT>
<DD>Generic headers, such as introduction, methodology, and evaluation, represent generic logical purposes of sections, mapping specific sections names to generic ones (i.e. .5. Text Features. . Methodology).  This promotes comparative viewing of sections with identical purpose across articles.
</DD>

<DT>Why is there an option to input file in XML format? Which DTD should it follows?</DT>
<DD>SectLabel is a robust logical document structure inference system that can handle both rich input (produced by OCR software such as font or spatial features) to boost the performance, but still be able to perform inference on impoverished input (plain text) with degraded performance. XML input is currently implied to be the results of Nuance OmniPage (version 16) in XML form, and hence, should follows the DTD by OmniPage. <BR>
</DD>

<A name="t"></a><H2>Troubleshooting</H2>

<P> A list of common problems with ParsCit.  If you find problems,
email the lead developer at &lt;kanmy@comp.nus.edu.sg&gt;.  Please use
the subject "[ParsCit]" to ensure that it reaches our attention.  If
you have hand-corrected tagged data that you don't mind providing us,
we can use that to further improve ParsCit's extracting capabilities.
Nevertheless, there are problems with the output occasionally.  Below
are some common problems people have encountered.

<DL>
<DT>Issue numbers don't get extracted.</DT>
<DD>We're looking into this.  The training data does not make a
distinction about volume and issue number.  We'd like to fix that in a
subsequent release.
</DD>
<DT>Separation of author names and publishing year fails</DT>
<DD> In some reference data with non-standard sequences of
 first names and family names, e.g.
<pre>
  Baltes, Paul, Ursula Staudinger, Ulmann Lindenberger (1999): Lifespan
  psychology: theory and application of intellectual functioning; in:
  Annual Review of Psychology, 50, 471-507
</pre>
ParsCit's post processing step may not detect and deal with these
problems reliably.  We're working to fix these too.
</DD>
<DT>I passed ParsCit plain text output but in another, non-English language.  I didn't get good results or I got empty results.  Can you help? 
</DT>
<DD>Aside from English, ParsCit can handle Italian and German to a limited extent, thanks to the multilingual training data.  However, the demo web interface uploads non-ASCII (e.g., UTF-8 or UTF-16 data) as binary data and fails to execute ParsCit.  However, if you download a copy of ParsCit, the libraries do work on such data.  Here's a <A HREF="humanities.test.out.xml">sample</A>.

We'd love to help make a more universal model that can accommodate reference strings in other languages.  If you're willing to help contribute ground truth data, we love to hear from you!  
</DD>
<DT>How about retraining ParsCit for another language/domain?
</DT>
<DD>You can put your supervised exemplar data into the same format as tagged_references.txt found in crfpp/traindata/.  Once you have this file you can generate the appropriate model for ParsCit, by using three commands (assumes you are in the crfpp/traindata directory):
<P>
<CODE>$ ../../bin/tr2crfpp.pl tagged_references.txt > parsCit.train.data
<BR>
$ ../crf_learn parsCit.template parsCit.train.data model
<BR>
$ mv model ../../resources/parsCit.model
</CODE>
<P>The first command creates the input feature file that crfpp uses
from the training data.  The second creates the model using the
crf_learn command.  You can then move the model file to the resources/ subdirectory where it can be utilized.  To replace the default model that comes with ParsCit, just execute the final command.  
</DD> 
<DT> Can I retrain the package for a different set of tags if I change
the tagset in the training data?</DT>
<DD> Yes, you should be able to change the tagset to suit your
dataset.  You can add, eliminate and change the tagset as you wish.
You need to retrain the parser system after creating your tag data.
For more details on the training process, see the documentation for
CRF++, that is on the web at sourceforge.     
</DD>
<DT>When retraining I get a "bad_alloc" error.  What gives?</DT>
<DD>We're not entirely sure of this.  CRF training is quite memory
intensive and running a large amount of training data tuples may cause
the embedded CRF++ package to fail.  You can try with less training
data, or try training on a machine with a larger amount of RAM.
</DD> 
<DT>Does the web service actually work? I can't seem to run it.</DT>
<DD>Occasionally our school's networking staff changes the firewall
settings, so the port for our group's web services may be blocked
(port 4000 on host wing.comp.nus.edu.sg).  If you find you can't
reach our services (they time out), please let us know.  </DD>
<DT>I get funny errors with crf_test not being useful.  How do I fix this?</DT>
<DD>The updated README.txt file in the 090625b distribution fixes
this.  Basically you need to recompile CRF++ 0.51 and place the
libraries and the executables in the proper place. See the README for
details.</DD>
</DL>
